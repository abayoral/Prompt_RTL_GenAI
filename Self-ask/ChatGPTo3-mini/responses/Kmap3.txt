    // Clarifying question:
    // "Can we treat the don't-care cells as having values that minimize the logic implementation?"
    // (The answer provided was yes.)

    // Based on the Karnaugh map and by choosing the don't-care cells appropriately,
    // one effective simplification is to cover the eight cells where a=1 and then
    // cover the two remaining ones (in the (a,b) = (0,1) column for rows cd and cd').
    // This yields the sum-of-products expression:
    //     out = a + (b & c)
    // Note that a + (~a & b & c) simplifies to a + (b & c).

    assign out = a | (b & c);
