The one clarifying question is: "Just to confirm, is this module intended to perform a purely combinational reversal of the input (i.e. out[0] gets in[99], out[1] gets in[98], etc.) without any clock or reset signals?"

Based on your confirmation, here is the complete Verilog module:

module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output reg [99:0] out
);
    integer i;
    
    always @(*) begin
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin
            out[i] = in[99 - i];
        end
    end

endmodule
