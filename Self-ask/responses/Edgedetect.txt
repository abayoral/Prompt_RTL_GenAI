Thank you for the clarification. Here is the complete Verilog module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

    reg [7:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        pedge <= (~prev_in) & in; // Detect the rising edge on each bit
        prev_in <= in;
    end

endmodule
```

This module detects rising edges on each bit of the 8-bit input vector `in` and outputs a corresponding bit in the `pedge` vector in the next clock cycle after the 0 to 1 transition.
