Thank you for the clarification. Based on the description and constraints provided, here is the complete Verilog module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot,
    input mode,
    input fan_on,
    output heater,
    output aircon,
    output fan
);

    // Heater is turned on in heating mode when it's too cold
    assign heater = mode & too_cold;

    // Air conditioner is turned on in cooling mode when it's too hot
    assign aircon = ~mode & too_hot;

    // Fan is on when either the heater or air conditioner is on, or when requested
    assign fan = heater | aircon | fan_on;

endmodule
```
