Thank you for the clarification. Here is the complete Verilog module based on the provided specifications:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

    reg [7:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        prev_in <= in;
        anyedge <= in & ~prev_in;
    end

endmodule
```
