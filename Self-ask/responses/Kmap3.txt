Thank you for confirming the inputs. Let's create the Verilog module based on the given Karnaugh map. 

The process starts with simplifying the K-map. After simplifying both product-of-sums (POS) and sum-of-products (SOP) forms, we can implement the resulting logic expression in Verilog. 

Given the K-map:

|       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|
| c'd'  | d    | 0    | 1   | 1   |
| c'd   | 0    | 0    | d   | d   |
| cd    | 0    | 1    | 1   | 1   |
| cd'   | 0    | 1    | 1   | 1   |

Let's derive the simplified expression.

- SOP (Sum of Products):
  - With grouping, one possible solution leads to the function being simplified to: 
    `out = a'cd + a'b'c + bcd + ab'd'`

Now, I'll provide the implementation for this above expression in Verilog:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out
);

    assign out = (~a & c & d) | (~a & ~b & c) | (b & c & d) | (a & ~b & ~d);

endmodule
```

Here, the `assign` statement maps the simplified Boolean expression to the output `out`.
