I don't have specific design requirements or constraints besides optimizing the simplification of the Karnaugh map. Therefore, I'll proceed with the simplification process to determine a simpler implementation. Let's work from the Karnaugh map to derive the simplified Boolean expression.

Given the Karnaugh map:

    |       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
    |-------|------|------|-----|-----|
    | c'd'  | 0    | 1    | 0   | 1   |
    | c'd   | 1    | 0    | 1   | 0   |
    | cd    | 0    | 1    | 0   | 1   |
    | cd'   | 1    | 0    | 1   | 0   |

The Sum of Products (SOP) form from the map would be:

f(a, b, c, d) = a'b'd + a'bd' + ab'd + abd'

The Product of Sums (POS) form, after simplifying, is:

f(a, b, c, d) = (a' + c)(b' + d)

Next, I'll implement the simpler form in Verilog.

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out
);

    assign out = (a | c') & (b | d');

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements the simplified Boolean expression derived from the Karnaugh map using the Product of Sums form.
