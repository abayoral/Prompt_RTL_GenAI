Your question is unnecessary because the specification already states that the module is a "half adder." Let's proceed with the implementation of the half adder module. 

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b,
    output cout, 
    output sum );

    assign sum = a ^ b;   // Sum is the XOR of a and b
    assign cout = a & b;  // Carry-out is the AND of a and b

endmodule
```
