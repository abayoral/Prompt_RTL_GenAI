Thank you for the clarification. I'll proceed with the implementation of the 100-bit ripple-carry adder using 100 full adders.

```verilog
module full_adder (
    input a, b, cin,
    output sum, cout
);
    assign {cout, sum} = a + b + cin;
endmodule

module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output [99:0] cout,
    output [99:0] sum 
);
    genvar i;
    wire [99:0] carry;

    assign carry[0] = cin; // Initial carry-in

    generate
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin: full_adder_array
            full_adder fa (
                .a(a[i]),
                .b(b[i]),
                .cin(carry[i]),
                .sum(sum[i]),
                .cout(cout[i])
            );
            if (i < 99) begin
                assign carry[i+1] = cout[i];
            end
        end
    endgenerate
endmodule
```

This implementation creates a full adder for each bit and connects it to the next, passing along the carry-out of each adder as the carry-in of the next. The `cout[99]` acts as the final carry-out of the 100-bit adder.
