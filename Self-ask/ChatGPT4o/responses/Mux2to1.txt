No additional clarification is needed as the function of the Verilog module is clearly described as a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer. I will proceed to create the module.

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input sel,
    output out 
);

    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```
