Thank you for the clarification. Based on the Karnaugh map provided, the output is always '1' regardless of the values of inputs a, b, and c. Thus, the simplified Boolean expression for this circuit is just a constant '1'. Here is the Verilog module implementing this solution:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output out
); 

    // Since the output is constantly '1' for all combinations
    assign out = 1'b1;

endmodule
```
