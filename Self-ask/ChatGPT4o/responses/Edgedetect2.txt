Thank you for the clarification. Based on the specification and your response, here's the complete Verilog module that detects when the input signal changes from one clock cycle to the next and sets the output bit for cycles following a 0 to 1 transition.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

    reg [7:0] in_d; // to store delayed input

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        anyedge <= (in_d ^ in) & ~in_d; // Capture any 0 to 1 transition
        in_d <= in; // Update delayed input
    end
endmodule
```
