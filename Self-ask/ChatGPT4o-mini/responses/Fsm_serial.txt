Thank you for the clarification. I will now proceed to generate the Verilog module based on the provided information. 

```
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output reg done
); 

    typedef enum reg [2:0] {IDLE, START, DATA, STOP} state_t;
    state_t current_state, next_state;
    
    reg [3:0] bit_count; // to count the received bits
    
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
            bit_count <= 0;
            done <= 0;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    always @* begin
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                done = 0;
                if (in == 0) // Detect start bit
                    next_state = START;
                else
                    next_state = IDLE;
            end
            START: begin
                if (in == 0) // Continue to wait for a start bit
                    next_state = DATA;
                else
                    next_state = IDLE;
            end
            DATA: begin
                bit_count = bit_count + 1;
                if (bit_count < 8)
                    next_state = DATA;
                else
                    next_state = STOP;
            end
            STOP: begin
                done = (in == 1); // Check if stop bit is 1
                next_state = IDLE; // Reset to IDLE to wait for the next byte
            end
            default: next_state = IDLE;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
