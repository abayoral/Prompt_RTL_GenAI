### Background Knowledge

#### Verilog Basics
1. **Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) Fundamentals**:
   - Verilog is used to model electronic systems at the register-transfer level (RTL), gate level, and behavioral level.
   - Verilog consists of two types of descriptions: behavioral (high-level) and structural (low-level).

2. **Syntax and Constructs**:
   - **Modules and Ports**: Fundamental building blocks where a design is encapsulated.
   - **Data Types**: `reg` for storage elements and `wire` for combinational logic connections.
   - **Operators**: Includes arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), logical/logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`), bitwise (`&`, `|`, `~`, `^`), and others.

#### Verilog Design Principles

1. **Hierarchy**:
   - Design should be modular with clear hierarchy, using modules and instance them to build complex systems.

2. **Combinational vs. Sequential Logic**:
   - **Combinational Logic**: Logic without memory where output is a pure function of current inputs.
   - **Sequential Logic**: Logic with memory where output depends on the current inputs and the history of inputs.

3. **Synchronous Design**:
   - Synchronous designs use a clock signal to ensure predictable timing and sequencing of operations.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Use meaningful signal names.
   - Keep modules small and focused on single functionality.
   - Minimize the use of magic numbers; use parameters or `localparam`.
   - Always simulate and verify designs before synthesizing.

#### Common Patterns

1. **Multiplexers**:
   - A multiplexer is a device that selects one of several input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line.

2. **Ternary Operator**:
   - Syntax: `condition ? true_value : false_value`
   - Widely used in Verilog for concise conditional assignment.

3. **Parameters for Constants**:
   - Use `parameter` or `localparam` for defining constants instead of hardcoding, which makes code maintainable.

4. **Non-blocking (`<=`) vs. Blocking (`=`) Assignment**:
   - Use blocking (`=`) for combinational logic and non-blocking (`<=`) for sequential logic in always blocks.

### Common Design Patterns in Verilog

1. **Basic Module Structure**:
   - Always define module with clear inputs and outputs.
   
2. **Parameterizable Components**:
   - Use parameters to make modules reusable with different data widths or other configurations.

3. **State Machines**:
   - Utilize finite state machines for controlling complex processes with well-defined states and transitions.

4. **Pipelining**:
   - For high-speed designs, use pipelining to break down lengthy combinational logic into stages.

### Best Practices

1. **Consistency**:
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions and formatting for readability.

2. **Testbenches**:
   - Write comprehensive testbenches to simulate and verify the functionality of your design.

3. **Avoid Non-synthesizable Constructs**:
   - Make sure to use constructs that are synthesizable for FPGA/ASIC implementation, avoiding delays (`#`), initial blocks, etc.

### Structured Information for Common Verilog Design Tasks

1. **Coding Style**:
   - Prefer explicit declaration of all signals involved.
   - Clearly comment the purpose and functionality of each section of your code.

2. **Multiplexer Example**:
   - Example: A 2-to-1 multiplexer can be described succinctly using the ternary operator to improve readability, e.g., `out = sel ? b : a;`.

3. **General Pattern for Multiplexers**:
   - Multi-bit multiplexers can be easily dealt with using the same succinct ternary operator approach.

By understanding these principles, best practices, and common patterns, it will create a robust foundation for generating effective Verilog code for a variety of design tasks.



Task:
// Create a 100-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer. When sel=0, choose a. When sel=1, choose b.

// Hint: The ternary operator (cond ? iftrue : iffalse) is easier to read.


module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input sel,
    output [99:0] out );

    // Insert your code here
    
endmodule
