### Background Knowledge

#### 1. **Verilog HDL Basics**
   - **Hardware Description Language (HDL)**: Verilog is used to describe digital and mixed-signal systems such as FPGAs and ASICs.
   - **Modules and Ports**: Modules are the basic building blocks in Verilog. Ports define the inputs and outputs of a module.
   - **Parameter**: Parameters are used to define constants that can be used within a module.

#### 2. **Combinational vs Sequential Logic**
   - **Combinational Logic**: Logic that outputs based solely on the current inputs (e.g., an AND gate).
   - **Sequential Logic**: Logic that has memory and changes output based on both current inputs and the current state (e.g., a flip-flop).

### Verilog Specific Constructs

#### 1. **Data Types**
   - **reg**: Used to declare variables that store values in procedural blocks.
   - **wire**: Used for connecting components, primarily for combinational logic.

#### 2. **Control Statements and Constructs**
   - **always block**: Used for procedural code. It can be triggered by changes in signals (e.g., `always @(posedge clk)`).
   - **Case statements**: Efficient for implementing state machines (e.g., `case (state)`).
   - **if-else statements**: Used for conditional branching.

### Principles in Verilog Design

#### 1. **State Machines**
   - **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**: Consist of states, transitions, and actions.
     - **Moore Machine**: Output depends only on the current state.
     - **Mealy Machine**: Output depends on the current state and current inputs.

#### 2. **Design Structure**
   - **Module Hierarchy**: Breaking down the design into multiple modules.
   - **Parameterization**: Use of parameters to increase design flexibility.

#### 3. **Coding Best Practices**
   - **Descriptive Naming**: Always use descriptive names for signals and modules.
   - **Comments**: Use comments liberally to describe functionality, especially in complex logic.
   - **Reset Signals**: Include asynchronous or synchronous resets in sequential logic to initialize states.

### Common Patterns in Verilog

#### 1. **State Machine Implementation Pattern**
   - **State Encoding**: Use binary encoding for states.
   - **Next State Logic**: Implement using a `case` statement inside an `always @*` block.
   - **Output Logic**: Implement the output based only on the current state for a Moore machine.

#### 2. **Parameterized Modules**
   - Using `parameter` to define constants such as state values, making the code more readable and modifiable.

#### 3. **Clock and Reset Handling**
   - **Synchronous Reset**: Reset logic inside the always block triggered by clock edge.
   - **Asynchronous Reset**: Reset signal has priority and can reset any time, often implemented with a dedicated always block.

### Structured Knowledge

#### Verilog Module Definition
- **Module Syntax**: Define module with inputs and outputs. Use `parameter` to define constants.
  
#### State Machine Design
- **State Declaration**:
  ```verilog
  parameter [1:0] A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01, C = 2'b10, D = 2'b11;
  ```

- **State Transition Logic**:
  - Use a `case` statement:
    ```verilog
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            A: if (input_signal) next_state = B; else next_state = A;
            B: if (input_signal) next_state = B; else next_state = C;
            C: if (input_signal) next_state = D; else next_state = A;
            D: if (input_signal) next_state = B; else next_state = C;
        endcase
    end
    ```

- **Output Logic**:
  - Use a combinational block to set the output based on the current state:
    ```verilog
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            A, B, C: output_signal = 0;
            D: output_signal = 1;
        endcase
    end
    ```

### Verilog Debugging Tips
- **Simulation**: Always simulate your design to verify correctness before synthesis.
- **Waveform Analysis**: Use waveform viewers to check signal transitions.
- **Assertions**: Use SystemVerilog assertions to validate state transitions and outputs.

Task:
// The following is the state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. Use the following state encoding: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11.

// Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine. Given the current state (state), compute the next_state and output (out) based on the state transition table.

//	 	 	  Next state

//	State					Output
