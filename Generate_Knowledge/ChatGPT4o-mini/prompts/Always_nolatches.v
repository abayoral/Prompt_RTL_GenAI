## Verilog Design Knowledgebase

### General Concepts in Verilog Design

1. **Verilog Basics**: 
   - **Modules**: The building blocks in Verilog are called modules. A module consists of inputs, outputs, and internal logic.
   - **Data Types**: Common data types include `wire` (for combinational signals) and `reg` (for storage elements and combinational logic in always blocks).

2. **Always Blocks**: 
   - **Sensitivity List**: The `always` block can be triggered by specific signals. The sensitivity list indicates when the always block should be evaluated.
   - **Combinational Logic**: Use `always @(*)` to indicate that the block should be evaluated any time any signal it depends on changes.

3. **Blocking vs. Non-blocking Assignments**:
   - **Blocking (`=`)**: Executes statements sequentially.
   - **Non-blocking (`<=`)**: Executes statements concurrently, commonly used in sequential logic.

### Principles

1. **Default Assignments**: 
   - Always initialize outputs to avoid unintended latches. Assign default values at the beginning of an always block.
  
2. **Case Statements**:
   - Useful for selecting between multiple options based on a signal's value.
   - Include a default case to handle unexpected values.

3. **Avoiding Latches**:
   - Ensure that all outputs are assigned in all branches of your control structures (e.g., case, if-else) to prevent unintended storage elements (latches).

4. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Design**:
   - Synchronous design makes use of clocks and is easier to manage and debug.
   - Asynchronous design relies on signal changes and should be carefully managed to avoid race conditions.

### Common Patterns

1. **MUX (Multiplexer)**:
   - Selecting one of several inputs to pass through to an output.
   - Commonly implemented with a case statement.

2. **Flip-Flops**:
   - Used to store state, typically in synchronous designs.
   - Design often includes a clock and possibly a reset signal.

3. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**:
   - Used for control logic by defining states and transitions based on inputs.
   - Typically involves sequential logic for state transitions and combinational logic for output generation.

### Best Practices

1. **Code Readability**:
   - Use meaningful names for signals and modules.
   - Comment code extensively to explain the design logic and decisions.

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Break larger designs into smaller, manageable modules to improve readability and reusability.
   - Use parameterization to make modules more flexible.

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Write testbenches to simulate and verify the functionality of your design.
   - Use assertions and coverage metrics to ensure thorough verification.

### Specific Application Considerations

1. **Scancode Processing**:
   - Scancodes are typically represented in hexadecimal.
   - Use case statements for decoding specific scancodes.
   - Cast or translate scancodes into meaningful key actions (e.g., arrow keys).

2. **Keyboard Handling**:
   - Ensure debouncing and proper timing if scanning directly from keyboard inputs.
   - Use a state machine to handle various states such as key press, key release, and multi-byte scancodes.

### Example Application Structure

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - Define a single `input` representing the 16-bit scancode.
  - Define separate `outputs` for each key action (left, right, up, down).

- **Internal Logic**:
  - Use an always block for combinational logic to update outputs based on the input scancode.
  - Assign default values to outputs to avoid latches.
  - Implement a case statement within the always block to set the appropriate output high when detecting the specific scancodes for the arrow keys. Ensure all outputs are assigned in every case, including the default case.

This structured knowledgebase should serve as a comprehensive foundation for generating Verilog modules effectively and efficiently.

Task:
// Suppose you're building a circuit to process scancodes from a PS/2 keyboard for a game. 
// Given the last two bytes of scancodes received, you need to indicate whether one of the 
// arrow keys on the keyboard have been pressed. This involves a fairly simple mapping, 
// which can be implemented as a case statement (or if-elseif) with four cases.


// Scancode [15:0]	Arrow key
// 16'he06b		left arrow
// 16'he072		down arrow
// 16'he074		right arrow
// 16'he075		up arrow
// Anything else	none

// Hint: Your circuit has one 16-bit input, and four outputs. Build this circuit that 
// recognizes these four scancodes and asserts the correct output.

// To avoid creating latches, all outputs must be assigned a value in all possible conditions. 
// Simply having a default case is not enough. You must assign a value to all four outputs in 
// all four cases and the default case. This can involve a lot of unnecessary typing. 
// One easy way around this is to assign a "default value" to the outputs before the case statement:

// always @(*) begin
//    up = 1'b0; down = 1'b0; left = 1'b0; right = 1'b0;
//    case (scancode)
//        ... // Set to 1 as necessary.
//    endcase
// end
