### Verilog Design Knowledge Base

#### General Concepts
1. **Digital Design Basics**:
   - Combinational Logic: Circuits whose output depends only on the current inputs.
   - Sequential Logic: Circuits whose output depends on the input as well as the history of inputs (state).

2. **Verilog Constructs**:
   - Modules: The basic building block in Verilog, similar to a function or a class in programming languages.
   - Always Blocks: Used to describe behavior that should be evaluated whenever certain signals change.
   - Continuous Assignments: Used for combinational logic, typically with `assign` statement.
   - Sensitivity List: Part of the `always` block that specifies when the block should be executed (e.g., `@ (posedge clk)` for clock edge triggering).
   
3. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**:
   - States: Various conditions in which the FSM can exist, typically represented in binary.
   - State Transition: The change from one state to another based on input conditions.
   - Output Logic: Defines what the output should be for each state or transition.

#### Principles and Best Practices
1. **State Encoding**: Use binary encoding, one-hot encoding, or Gray code depending on efficiency and ease of state transition implementation.
2. **Clock Management**: Ensure synchronous design with all state changes occurring on clock edges to prevent race conditions and glitches.
3. **Reset Logic**: Include reset functionality to set the FSM to a known state during initialization.
4. **Avoid Latches**: Ensure all variables are assigned in all possible conditional branches to avoid unintended latches.
5. **Code Readability**: Use meaningful names for states and signals. Maintain good comments and structured formatting.
6. **Modularity**: Break down complex designs into smaller sub-modules for easier debugging and maintenance.

#### Common Patterns
1. **Sequential Logic**:
   - `always @(posedge clk)`: Used for synchronous sequential logic.
   - `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)`: Include reset condition for initializing state.

2. **Combinational Logic**:
   - `always @(*)`: Indicates that the block should execute whenever any of the signals in the block change.
   - `assign`: Direct continuous assignment for simple combinational logic.

3. **State Machine Structure**:
   - **State Definitions**: Use `parameter` or `localparam` for state definitions.
   - **State Register**: A register to hold the current state.
   - **Next State Logic**: Combinational logic to determine the next state based on current state and inputs.
   - **Output Logic**: Logic to determine the output based on the current state or transitions.

### Example Knowledge Integration
Given the finite state machine (FSM):

#### FSM Breakdown:
- **States (y[2:0])**:
  - 000, 001, 010, 011, 100
- **Inputs**:
  - `x`
- **Next States and Outputs**:
  - Transition and output logic based on `x` and `y`
  
1. **State Machine Encoding**:
   - Use binary encoding for states: `000`, `001`, `010`, `011`, `100`.
   
2. **State Transition Table**:
   - Create a table mapping current state and input `x` to the next state and output `z`.

3. **State Change and Output Logic**:
   - Define `next_state` and `z` based on the current state (`y`) and input (`x`).

#### Implementation Idea
1. **State Register**: To hold the current state:
   - `always @(posedge clk)` for state transition.
   
2. **Next State Calculation**:
   - Use `case` or `if/else` statements inside an `always @(*)` block.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - Define `z` based on the current state.

By having this background knowledge, principles, and structured information, a language model tasked with generating Verilog modules can effectively design and implement various modules with proper structure, logic, and readability. This approach ensures a consistent methodology applicable to different Verilog design tasks.

Task:
// Given the state-assigned table shown below, implement the logic functions Y[0] and z.

//Present state 		Next state Y[2:0]
//		y[2:0]								Output z
//							x=0	x=1
						
//		000					000	001				0
//		001					001	100				0
//		010					010	001				0
//		011					001	010				1
//		100					011	100				1
