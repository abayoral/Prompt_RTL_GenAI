### Comprehensive Knowledge Base for Generating Verilog Modules

#### General Concepts in Verilog Design:
1. **Hardware Description**: Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is used for designing and verifying digital circuits at different levels of abstraction.
  
2. **Modules**: The basic building block of Verilog. Each module has a name and a port declaration and can encapsulate other modules, logic, and procedural code.
  
3. **Hierarchical Design**: Involves defining smaller submodules that perform specific tasks and then integrating them into a larger top-level module. This approach promotes reusability and better organization.

4. **Sequential Circuits**: Circuits that have memory elements (like flip-flops) and can change states based on clock signals. They are used to maintain state information.

5. **Combinational Circuits**: Circuits without memory elements, their output depends solely on the current input.

6. **Flip-Flops**: Basic memory elements used in sequential circuits. Common types are D flip-flops, used to store a single bit of data.

7. **Multiplexers (MUX)**: A combinational circuit that selects one of many input signals and directs it to a single output line.

#### Best Practices in Verilog Design:
1. **Clarity**: Write clear and concise code. Use meaningful names for modules, signals, and variables.

2. **Modularity**: Design in a modular fashion. Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable submodules.

3. **Parameterization**: Use parameters to create flexible and reusable modules.

4. **Synchronization**: Ensure proper synchronization of signals when dealing with sequential logic.

5. **State Machine Design**: Use finite state machines (FSM) to design complex sequential logic. Use clear state encoding and transitions.

6. **Comments**: Provide comments to explain complex sections of the code, state machine transitions, etc.

#### Common Patterns in Verilog Design:
1. **Module Instantiation**: Reuse modules by instantiating them in higher-level modules.
   ```verilog
   modulename instance_name (.port1(signal1), .port2(signal2), ...);
   ```

2. **Always Blocks**: Used to describe sequential and combinational logic. 
   - Sequential (Triggered by clock)
     ```verilog
     always @(posedge clk) begin
       // Sequential logic
     end
     ```
   - Combinational
     ```verilog
     always @(*) begin
       // Combinational logic
     end
     ```

3. **Non-blocking vs. Blocking Assignments**:
   - Non-blocking (`<=`): Used in sequential logic to avoid race conditions.
   - Blocking (`=`): Used in combinational logic within `always @*` blocks.

4. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Used for designing control logic. Typically involves states, transitions, and outputs.

5. **Conditional Statements**:
   - `if-else` for mutually exclusive conditions.
   - `case` statements for selecting between several possibilities.

#### General Structure of a Submodule:
1. **Port Declaration**: Define inputs, outputs, and inouts.
2. **Parameter Definition (if any)**: Allow customization of module behavior.
3. **Internal Signals**: Define internal wires and registers.
4. **Combinational Logic**: Use `always @*` blocks for MUX and other combinational logic.
5. **Sequential Logic**: Use `always @(posedge clk or negedge reset)` for flip-flops and other synchronous logic.
6. **initial/Final Blocks**: Sometimes used for testbenches but not for synthesis.

#### Example Principles (without code):
- **Flip-Flop Logic**: Capture the state of a signal at each clock edge.
- **MUX Logic**: Select one input from multiple possible inputs based on a selector signal.
- **State Retention**: Use flip-flops to store the state information across clock cycles.
- **Reset Logic**: Initialize your flip-flop states using a reset signal (asynchronously or synchronously).

By incorporating these principles, structured information, and best practices, another language model can generate robust, efficient, and maintainable Verilog modules.

Task:
// Assume that you want to implement hierarchical Verilog code for a sequential circuit, using three instantiations of a submodule that has a flip-flop and multiplexer in it. Write a Verilog module (containing one flip-flop and multiplexer) named top_module for this submodule.

module top_module (
	input clk,
	input L,
	input r_in,
	input q_in,
	output reg Q);

	// Insert your code here

endmodule
