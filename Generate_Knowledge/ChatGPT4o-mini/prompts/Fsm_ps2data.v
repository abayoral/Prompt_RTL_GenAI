In order to generate a comprehensive knowledge base for Verilog design, it is essential to cover various foundational principles, best practices, and common patterns. Here is a set of detailed information to support the enhancement of another language model tasked with generating Verilog modules.

### Fundamental Concepts

1. **Registers and Wire Types**:
    - **Registers (`reg`)**: Used to store values in sequential logic. These can hold data until the next clock cycle.
    - **Wires (`wire`)**: Used for continuous assignment in combinational logic. They cannot store state.

2. **Modules**:
    - Basic building blocks in Verilog.
    - Contains inputs, outputs, and internal logic.
    - Modules can be instantiated within other modules to create a hierarchy.

3. **Always Blocks**:
    - **Sequential Always Block (`always @(posedge clk)`):** Used for describing synchronous logic where changes occur on the clockâ€™s edge.
    - **Combinational Always Block (`always @(*)`):** Used for describing combinational logic.

4. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**:
    - Composed of states, transitions, and outputs.
    - Two types: Moore (outputs depend only on states) and Mealy (outputs depend on states and inputs).

### Best Practices

1. **Reset Handling**:
    - Use synchronous resets as they are more predictable and easier to analyze timing-wise.

2. **Describing State Machines**:
    - Use separate blocks for state transitions and state memory to clarify logic.

3. **Naming Conventions**:
    - Use clear and consistent names for signals, states, and modules.
    - Prefix signals with `i_`, `o_`, or `r_` for input, output, and registers, respectively.

4. **Parameterization**:
    - Use parameters to make modules reusable and configurable.

5. **Avoid Latches**:
    - Ensure every register has a definite value assignment in every branch of your combinational logic to avoid inadvertent latches.

### Common Design Patterns

1. **State Machines**:
    - **State Encoding**: Use enums or parameters to encode states.
    - **State Register**: Use a single register to hold the current state.
    
    Example pseudo-code for FSM:
    ```verilog
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
            IDLE,
            STATE1,
            STATE2,
            STATE3
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    always_ff @ (posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= IDLE;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    always_comb begin
        next_state = current_state;
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: if (condition) next_state = STATE1;
            // additional states
        endcase
    end
    ```

2. **Datapath and Control**:
    - **Datapath (Data Processing)**: Includes mathematical and logical operations.
    - **Control Path (Decision Making)**: Includes FSMs to manage the flow.

3. **Signal Synchronization**:
    - When crossing clock domains, use synchronization techniques to avoid metastability.

### Specific Patterns for Handling Byte Streams

1. **Byte Accumulation**:
    - Accumulate incoming data into registers until a complete message is formed.
    
2. **Message Parsing with FSM**:
    - Discard bytes until the first byte meeting a specific condition is found (indicated by a flag in the FSM).
    - Accumulate the sequence of bytes until a complete message is detected according to predefined length.

3. **Output Handling**:
    - Assert a done signal whenever a complete message has been assembled.
    - Clear accumulated registers once the message has been processed to avoid data corruption.

### Example Structures

- **Timing Diagrams**: Understand how data and control signals change over time with respect to the clock.
- **Reset Logic**:
    ```verilog
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            signal <= 0;
        else
            signal <= next_signal;
    end
    ```
- **Control and Data Separation**: 
    ```verilog
    // Control FSM Module
    module fsm_control(...) // declarations and states

    // Data Module
    module data_path(...) // data handling and accumulation
    ```

By mastering these concepts, principles, and patterns, a language model can become adept at generating high-quality, reliable Verilog code suitable for a wide range of digital design tasks. This knowledge base fosters a structured approach to solve complex hardware design problems efficiently.

Task:
// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has bit[3]=1 (but bit[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data).

// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with bit[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done).


//Now that you have a state machine that will identify three-byte messages in a PS/2 byte stream, add a datapath that will also output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.).

// out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care).


// Hint: Use the FSM from PS/2 packet parser and add a datapath to capture the incoming bytes.

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [23:0] out_bytes,
    output done); //

    // Insert your code below
    
    // FSM from fsm_ps2

    // New: Datapath to store incoming bytes.
