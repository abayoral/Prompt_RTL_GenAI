### Knowledge Base for Generating Verilog Modules

#### 1. Verilog Basics
- **Module Declaration**: A Verilog module defines a circuit and includes a name, input and output ports, and internal logic.
- **Ports**: Inputs, outputs, and inout ports define how a module interfaces with other modules.
- **Data Types**: Commonly used data types include `reg` and `wire`. `Reg` is used for storage elements, while `wire` is for connecting elements.

#### 2. Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Break down designs into smaller, reusable modules.
- **Hierarchy**: Use hierarchical design principles to organize complex designs into submodules.
- **Parameterization**: Use parameters to make modules more flexible and reusable.

#### 3. Coding Styles
- **Structural**: Describes the composition of the module by enumerating instantiated submodules and their interconnections.
- **Behavioral**: Describes the moduleâ€™s functionality using high-level constructs like `always` blocks and continuous assignments.
- **Dataflow**: Describes how data moves through the system, often using continuous assignments with the `assign` keyword.

#### 4. Common Patterns
- **Combinational Logic**: Use continuous assignments (`assign` keyword) for purely combinational logic.
- **Sequential Logic**: Use `always` blocks for registers and state machines that require clocking.
- **Conditional Statements**: Use `if-else` or `case` statements for decision-making logic.

#### 5. Best Practices
- **Use Meaningful Names**: Clearly name signals, variables, and module instances for readability.
- **Indent Code**: Proper indentation helps in understanding code hierarchy.
- **Comment Code**: Annotate code to explain the logic, especially for complex sections.

#### 6. Verification
- **Testbenches**: Write testbenches to simulate and verify the functionality of your Verilog code.
- **Assertions**: Use assertions to check for expected conditions during simulation.

#### 7. Synthesis Considerations
- **Hardware Implementability**: Ensure that constructs used are synthesis-friendly. Avoid high-level constructs that are difficult to map to hardware.
- **Resource Utilization**: Be mindful of how many logic gates, flip-flops, and other resources are utilized by your design.

#### 8. Debugging
- **Waveform Analyzers**: Use simulation tools to visualize waveforms and debug issues.
- **Signal Probing**: Probe internal signals to capture intermediate states and trace the source of problems.

### Key Concepts for Equality Checking in Verilog

#### Binary Equality
- **Bitwise Comparison**: Two binary numbers can be compared bitwise using equality operators (`==`).

#### Output Assignment
- **Conditional Assignment**: Output can be assigned based on the result of the comparison.

#### Example Patterns
- **Equality Comparison**: Use the `==` operator to compare input vectors.
- **Output Assignment**: Use an `assign` statement for combinational output based on the comparison result.

### Application to the Provided Task
Given the task of creating a circuit that compares two 2-bit inputs and produces an output based on their equality:
1. **Inputs**: A[1:0] and B[1:0].
2. **Output**: z.
3. **Operation**: z should be 1 if A equals B; otherwise, z should be 0.
4. **Implementation**: This can be done using a simple equality comparison and assigning the result to z.

By understanding the above principles and patterns, a language model can efficiently generate Verilog code that will output `z` as 1 when `A` is equal to `B` and 0 otherwise.

Task:
// Create a circuit that has two 2-bit inputs A[1:0] and B[1:0], and produces an output z. 
// The value of z should be 1 if A = B, otherwise z should be 0.


module top_module ( input [1:0] A, input [1:0] B, output z ); 
	// Insert your code here
endmodule
