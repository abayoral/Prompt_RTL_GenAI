```
The 16 bits of `a` and `b` are broken down into two 16-bit pieces each. Using inverted `b` based on `sub` control signal, two 16 bit adder modules are instantiated for lower and upper halves respectively. The sum is collected by joining results of both adders. `sub` is also used as `cin` to first adder module and `cout` of the first adder is used as `cin` to the second adder.
