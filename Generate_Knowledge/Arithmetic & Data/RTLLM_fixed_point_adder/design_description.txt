Please consider the following task related to Verilog design: You are requested to develop a Verilog module named `fixed_point_adder` that serves as a parameterized fixed-point adder tailored for performing arithmetic operations with a defined fixed precision. Here's a detailed breakdown of what this module should encapsulate:

**Module Name:**
- `fixed_point_adder`

**Parameter Descriptions:**
- `Q`: This parameter specifies the number of fractional bits, which directly impacts the precision of the fixed-point operations. It's crucial for defining how many bits in the input and output numbers are dedicated to representing fractional values.
- `N`: This parameter sets the total number of bits for each number including both the integer and fractional parts, thus determining the overall bit-width of the operands and the result.

**Input Ports:**
- `a [N-1:0]`: This is the first input operand, represented as an N-bit fixed-point number.
- `b [N-1:0]`: This serves as the second input operand, also an N-bit fixed-point number.

**Output Ports:**
- `c [N-1:0]`: The output port which is intended to carry the N-bit result of the fixed-point addition operation performed on inputs `a` and `b`.

**Internal Registers:**
- `res [N-1:0]`: An internal N-bit register designed to temporarily hold the result of either the addition or subtraction conducted between the absolute values of the input operands.

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Absolute Value Addition:**
   - If the most significant bits (MSBs) of the inputs `a` and `b` are the same, indicating either both numbers are positive or negative, an absolute value addition should be performed.
   - The sign of the result (MSB of `res`) should be aligned with the shared sign of the inputs, maintaining consistency in sign representation.

2. **Absolute Value Subtraction:**
   - If the MSBs of `a` and `b` differ, suggesting that one number is positive and the other negative, the module needs to determine which input has the greater absolute value.
   - Depending on the comparison, the module should perform a subtraction (`a - b` or `b - a`) and determine the MSB of the result based on the outcome, ensuring the correct representation of non-zero or negative results.

3. **Precision Considerations:**
   - The operands `a` and `b` are composed of integer and fractional segments defined by `Q`, ensuring that fixed-point arithmetic maintains its precision.
   - Consistency is required in handling the precision across input operands and the resultant sum to guarantee the accuracy of computations.

4. **Overflow Management:**
   - The module should incorporate mechanisms to handle potential overflow conditions, carefully tracking the MSB to ascertain that the result does not exceed the allowable N-bit range.

By compiling these elements, you are to produce the full Verilog code that encapsulates the described functionalities.
