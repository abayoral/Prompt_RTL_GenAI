// you're a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company tasked with developing a critical Verilog module for a next-generation product. The success of this module is pivotal for maintaining my computer hardware company's reputation in the industry.

// You are provided with a BCD one-digit adder named bcd_fadd that adds 
// two BCD digits and carry-in, and produces a sum and carry-out.

module bcd_fadd (
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input     cin,
    output   cout,
    output [3:0] sum );
    
// Instantiate 100 copies of bcd_fadd to create a 100-digit BCD ripple-carry adder. 
//Your adder should add two 100-digit BCD numbers (packed into 400-bit vectors) 
//and a carry-in to produce a 100-digit sum and carry out.


// Hint: An instance array or generate statement would be useful here.
