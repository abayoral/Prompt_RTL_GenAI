### Comprehensive Knowledge Base for Verilog Design

#### 1. **Verilog HDL Overview**
Verilog is a hardware description language used for modeling electronic systems. It is commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at various levels of abstraction. This knowledge base includes essential principles, best practices, and common patterns to improve Verilog design tasks.
  
#### 2. **Core Concepts & Components**

- **Modules**: The basic building block in Verilog; similar to a class in software languages. A module defines input, output, and internal signals.
- **Always Blocks**: Used for describing sequential logic, combinational logic, or a mixture of both. Always blocks are sensitive to a list of signals.
  - **Combinational Logic**: Sensitive to changes in input signals (`always @(*)`).
  - **Sequential Logic**: Sensitive to clock edges (`always @(posedge clk)` or `always @(negedge clk)`).

#### 3. **FSM (Finite State Machines)**
FSMs are used to model the control flow of digital circuits. Key components include:
- **States**: Defined explicitly (e.g., `IDLE`, `COUNTDOWN`, `NOTIFY`).
- **State Transitions**: Conditions under which transitions between states occur.
- **Outputs**: Actions taken in each state.

##### Building FSMs in Verilog
1. **State Encoding**: Use `parameter` for state definitions.
2. **State Register**: A register to hold the current state.
3. **Next State Logic**: Determining the next state based on current state and inputs.
4. **Output Logic**: Specifying outputs based on the current state.

##### Best Practices for FSMs
- Keep state transition and output logic separate.
- Use enumerators or parameters for state definitions for better readability.
- Explicitly define all transitions to avoid unintended behaviors.

#### 4. **Sequential & Combinational Logic**

- **Sequential Logic**: Usually implemented in always blocks sensitive to clock edges. Typically reset logic is also included.
- **Combinational Logic**: Defined within always blocks or continuous assignments outside always blocks.

#### 5. **Common Design Patterns**

##### Shift Registers
Useful for serial data input and output operations.
- **Shift Register Implementation**:
  - Use always block with clock edge sensitivity.
  - Shift bits on each clock cycle.

##### Timers and Counters
Common in controlling the timing of operations.
- **Timer Implementation**:
  - Use a counter to count clock cycles.
  - Use parameters for setting predefined delays.

#### 6. **Synchronous & Asynchronous Logic**

- **Synchronous Logic** (recommended for better predictability):
  - All operations are coordinated by clock edges.
  - Use synchronous resets (`always @(posedge clk)` with `if (reset)`).

- **Asynchronous Logic**:
  - Operations can occur whenever their inputs change.
  - Requires careful handling to avoid glitches and meta-stability.

#### 7. **Handling Resets**
- **Synchronous Reset**:
  - Ensures the circuit returns to a known state on the next clock edge.
  - Typically incorporated within the sequential logic block.

- **Asynchronous Reset**:
  - Immediate reset without waiting for the clock edge.
  - May introduce complexity in timing analysis; typically, special care is needed in synchronous designs.

#### 8. **Assertions and Checking**
- **Formal Verification**:
  - Ensures the designed module behaves as expected under all possible input conditions.
  - Use SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) or similar constructs for verifying properties.

- **Testbenches**:
  - Simulate the Verilog module.
  - Include a set of stimuli to validate module functionality.

#### 9. **Best Practices**

- **Comment Code**: Provide sufficient comments to explain functionality and flow.
- **Modular Design**: Break down complex designs into smaller, reusable modules.
- **Code Clarity**: Avoid complex nested always blocks. Make code readable and maintainable.
- **Signal Naming**: Use meaningful signal names to improve readability.
- **Parameterization**: Use parameters to define configurable values instead of hardcoding constants.

#### 10. **Common Pitfalls**
- **Uninitialized Registers**: Always ensure registers are initialized properly.
- **Race Conditions**: Look out for unwanted interactions between combinational and sequential blocks.
- **Glitches**: Avoid combinational loops which can lead to transient problems (glitches).

#### Summary

By understanding these foundational concepts, principles, and best practices in Verilog design, one can create robust, readable, and maintainable Verilog code which enhances the performance and reliability of digital circuits. Whether designing simple timers, complex state machines, or intricate data paths, this knowledge base will serve as a strong guide.

Task:
// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,      // Synchronous reset
    input data,
    output [3:0] count,
    output counting,
    output done,
    input ack );

    // Insert your code here
