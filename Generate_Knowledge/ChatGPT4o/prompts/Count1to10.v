### Verilog Design Knowledgebase

#### 1. **Basic Concepts**

- **Modules:** Fundamental building blocks in Verilog. Each module can have inputs, outputs, and internal logic.
- **Registers and Wires:** 
  - `reg` is used to define storage elements, usually synthesized into flip-flops or latches.
  - `wire` is used to represent combinational logic.
- **Always Blocks:** Segments of code that are continuously executed. Common types are:
  - `always @(posedge clk)` for synchronous designs.
  - `always @*` for combinational logic.
- **Procedural Assignments:** Used within `always` blocks to assign values to `reg` types.

#### 2. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Reset**

- **Synchronous Reset:**
  - Reset signal is sampled by the clock.
  - Advantages include ease of timing analysis and no glitches.
  - Can potentially miss reset events if clock is not active.
- **Asynchronous Reset:**
  - Reset signal directly affects the flip-flops.
  - Clears flip-flops immediately, ensuring a known state.
  - May introduce glitches and timing issues.

#### 3. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**

- **FSM Design Patterns:**
  - **State Encoding:** Use binary, Gray code, or one-hot encoding for states.
  - **State Register:** Hold the current state.
  - **Next-State Logic:** Define transitions between states.
  - **Output Logic:** Define outputs based on the current state (Moore) or current state and inputs (Mealy).

#### 4. **Counter Design Principles**

- **Simple Counter:**
  - Incremental logic where the counter is increased/decreased by a constant value.
  - Requires a maximum value check to reset or wrap around.
- **Decade Counter (0-9 or 1-10):**
  - Counts in a specific range and wraps around after reaching a certain count.

#### 5. **Common Patterns and Practices**

- **Modular Design:**
  - Divide larger problems into smaller, manageable modules.
  - Promote reusability and ease of debugging.
- **Parameterized Modules:**
  - Use parameters to create more flexible and reusable modules.
- **Coding Style and Conventions:**
  - Use meaningful names for signals and variables.
  - Follow consistent indentation and comment your code for clarity.
- **Testbenches:**
  - Develop thorough testbenches to validate functionality.
  - Include both typical and edge cases.

#### 6. **Example Design Concepts**

- **Edge Detectors:**
  - Detect rising or falling edges of a signal.
- **State Machines in Data Processing:**
  - Buffering, serialization, and protocol handling.
- **Resource Sharing:**
  - Multiplexers to share common blocks between different data sources.
- **Pipelining:**
  - Break complex operations into stages to increase clock speed.

#### 7. **Verilog Constructs**

- **`always @(posedge clk)`:** Used for operations synchronous to the clock edge.
- **`if-else` and `case` constructs:** Conditional logic for control flow.
- **Sensitivity List:** Determines when to evaluate the `always` block.

#### 8. **Best Practices**

- **Reset Handling:**
  - Always initialize registers to a known state.
  - Prefer synchronous resets in synchronous designs.
- **Clock Domain Crossing:**
  - Use proper synchronization techniques to handle signals crossing clock domains.
- **Timing Constraints:**
  - Ensure timing constraints are met to avoid metastability and timing errors.
- **Power Optimization:**
  - Disable unused logic and use clock gating techniques where necessary.

#### 9. **Verification Techniques**

- **Simulation:**
  - Validate functionality using simulators.
- **Formal Verification:**
  - Use formal methods to prove the correctness of the design.
- **Code Coverage:**
  - Ensure comprehensive testing of all code paths.

By adhering to these principles, understanding these common patterns, and following best practices, one can enhance the quality and robustness of Verilog designs, while making the design process more efficient and error-free.

Task:
// Make a decade counter that counts 1 through 10, inclusive. The reset input is synchronous, and should reset the counter to 1.

    input clk,
    input reset,
    output [3:0] q);
