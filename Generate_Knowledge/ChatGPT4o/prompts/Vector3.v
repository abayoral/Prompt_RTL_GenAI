### Verilog Design Knowledge Base

#### 1. Basics of Verilog
- **Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language)**: Used for describing electronic circuits and systems.
- **Module**: The fundamental building block in Verilog, representing hardware blocks with defined inputs and outputs.
- **Data Types**:
  - **reg**: Used to store values in procedural blocks.
  - **wire**: Used to connect components; cannot store values.

#### 2. Structural and Behavioral Modeling
- **Structural Modeling**: Describes a system in terms of its interconnections between lower-level modules.
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Uses high-level constructs like `always` and `initial` blocks to describe the behavior.
- **Continuous Assignment**: Uses the `assign` keyword for real-time logic updates based on input changes.

#### 3. Vector Manipulation
- **Bitwise Operations in Verilog**:
  - Concatenation: `{a, b, c}` combines variables a, b, and c.
  - Slicing: Selecting bits from a vector, e.g., `a[5:0]`.
- **Padding**: Extend vectors by adding additional bits, e.g., `{a, 2'b11}` to append two '1's.

#### 4. Hierarchy and Modularity
- **Hierarchy**: Use modules to build hierarchical designs for better organization.
- **Parameters**: Define flexible and reusable modules by parameterizing bit-widths and other constants.

#### 5. Best Practices in Verilog Design
- **Clear Naming Conventions**: Use names that describe the functionality, such as `input_bus` or `output_bus`.
- **Defensive Coding**:
  - Ensure all possible conditions and states are handled.
  - Use default assignments to avoid latches in combinational logic.
- **Maintainability and Readability**: Proper indentation and organization of code with comments.
- **Code Optimization**: Balance between readability, complexity, and performance. Use minimal resources while achieving the intended functionality.

#### 6. Common Design Patterns and Techniques
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: A standard approach for control logic, including states, inputs, and transitions.
- **Pipeline Architecture**: For high-speed designs, implement staged processing to increase throughput.
- **Sequential Logic**:
  - Clocking: Use positive or negative edge of clock signals for synchronization.
  - Reset: Implement synchronous or asynchronous reset for initializing circuits.
- **Parameterization**: Generic module designs to reuse with different parameters like bit-widths.

#### 7. Example Use Case: Vector Concatenation and Splitting
1. **Concatenation**: Combine multiple input vectors into a single large vector.
   - Example: `{a, b, c, d, e, f}` to combine six 5-bit vectors into a single 30-bit vector.
2. **Appending Bits**: Add specific bits to extend the vector.
   - Example: `{combined_vector, 2'b11}` to append two '1' bits to the 30-bit vector to get a 32-bit vector.
3. **Splitting**: Divide a large vector into smaller output vectors of specified width.
   - Example: `{w, x, y, z} = large_vector` to split a 32-bit vector into four 8-bit output vectors.

These fundamental concepts and best practices will guide any Verilog module design, ensuring well-organized, maintainable, and efficient HDL code.

Task:
// Given several input vectors, concatenate them together then split them 
// up into several output vectors. There are six 5-bit input vectors: 
// a, b, c, d, e, and f, for a total of 30 bits of input. 
// There are four 8-bit output vectors: w, x, y, and z, for 32 bits of output. 
// The output should be a concatenation of the input vectors followed by two 1 bits.

module top_module (
    input [4:0] a, b, c, d, e, f,
    output [7:0] w, x, y, z );//

    // Insert your code below
    // assign { ... } = { ... };

endmodule
