To enhance the performance of a language model tasked with generating Verilog modules, it's essential to provide a well-rounded understanding of various aspects of Verilog design. This knowledgebase will cover fundamental concepts, best practices, and common patterns. Here's the structured information:

### 1. Basics of Verilog
- **Hierarchy**: Verilog designs are typically hierarchical, composed of modules that can be instantiated within other modules.
- **Module Definition**: A module is defined using the `module` keyword and ends with the `endmodule` keyword. 

### 2. Important Constructs
- **Always Blocks**: Used to describe combinational and sequential logic. Triggered by changes in signals mentioned in the sensitivity list.
- **Procedural Assignments**: Inside always blocks, use `<=` for non-blocking assignments (sequential logic) and `=` for blocking assignments (combinational logic).
- **Initial Block**: Used for initialization, runs once at the start of the simulation.
- **Continuous Assignments**: Use `assign` keyword for combinational logic outside always blocks.

### 3. Sequential Logic
- **Flip-Flops**: Created using edge-sensitive always blocks, typically triggered on the positive or negative edge of a clock signal.
- **State Machines**: One of the core elements of sequential logic, used to manage states and transitions. Usually composed of:
  - State Encoding
  - State Register (current state)
  - Next State Logic (combinational)
  - Output Logic (combinational)
  
### 4. Combinational Logic
- **Combinational Statements**: Deciders based on the current inputs, without reliance on clock edges.
- **Use of `case`, `if-else`, and `for`**: Helps describe complex combinational logic efficiently.
- **Conditional Operators (?:)**: Useful for concise expression of multiplexers and conditional assignments.

### 5. Finite State Machine (FSM) Design
- **State Encoding**: States can be encoded using parameters or `typedef` enums.
- **Transition Logic**: Determines the next state based on current state and inputs.
- **Output Logic**: Determines the output based on the current state and inputs.
- **State Transition Diagram**: A graphical representation can be useful before coding.

### 6. Reset Strategies
- **Synchronous Reset**: In the `always` block, often combined with other logic that should be reset.
  - Example: `if (reset) state <= IDLE; else state <= next_state;`
- **Asynchronous Reset**: Implies an immediate response to the reset signal, often used in flip-flops.

### 7. Communication Protocol Handling
- **Serial Communication Basics**:
  - Start Bit, Data Bits, Stop Bit
  - Idle State of the Line
- **Valid Signal Handling**: Using signals like `parity`, `done`, and `error`.
  
### 8. Verilog Best Practices
- **Code Modularity**: Split complex designs into smaller modules.
- **Readability**: Use comments, meaningful signal names, and clear indentation.
- **Synthesis Considerations**: Ensure that the Verilog code adheres to synthesis guidelines, using synthesizable constructs.
- **Testbenches**: Always verify with comprehensive testbenches, covering all possible states and transitions.

### 9. Common Patterns
- **Shift Registers**: For serial data handling (e.g., `always @(posedge clk) shift_reg <= {shift_reg[6:0], in};`).
- **Debounce Logic**: For noisy input signals, using multiple samples and majority voting.
- **Counters**: Often used for timing control within FSMs or as timers.

### 10. Debugging and Verification
- **Simulation with Waveform Viewing**: Using tools like ModelSim or Vivado.
- **Assertion-Based Verification (ABV)**: Using `assert` statements to ensure certain conditions in the design.
- **Formal Verification**: To mathematically prove properties of the design, complementary to simulation.

### 11. Synthesis Constraints
- **Timing Constraints**: Specifying clock requirements, setup, and hold times.
- **Area and Power Constraints**: To ensure the synthesized hardware meets the desired physical constraints.

By adhering to these principles and patterns, the performance of a language model in generating accurate and efficient Verilog modules can be significantly enhanced. It ensures the model has a broad and deep understanding of Verilog design practices, enabling it to create reliable, maintainable, and efficient hardware descriptions.

Task:
// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle).

// Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output done
);
