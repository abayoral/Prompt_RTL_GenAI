To enhance the performance of a language model tasked with generating Verilog modules, the following background knowledge, principles, and structured information are essential:

### Verilog Basics
1. **Verilog Constructs**:
    - **Modules**: Basic building blocks in Verilog.
    - **Inputs and Outputs**: Define how data enters and exits modules.
    - **Assignments**: Use continuous or procedural assignments to define logic.
    - **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, bitwise, reduction, relational, equality, shifting, and conditional operators.
  
2. **Data Types**:
    - **Net Types (`wire`)**: Used for continuous assignments.
    - **Variable Types (`reg`)**: Used for procedural assignments.

### Hierarchical Design
1. **Module Instantiation**: Allows reuse of modules within other modules.
2. **Parameters and Parameters Overrides**: Enable customization of module functionalities and sizes.

### Coding Principles
1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: Write readable, maintainable code.
2. **Modularity**: Break down complex designs into smaller, reusable modules.
3. **Non-blocking (`<=`) vs. Blocking (`=`) Assignments**: Differentiate usage within procedural blocks to avoid timing issues.
4. **Initial Blocks**: Mainly used for simulation and test benches, not synthesizable hardware.
5. **Sensitivity List**: Defines the conditions under which a piece of code executes (`always @(...)`).

### Simulation and Synthesis
1. **Simulation**: Checks the functional correctness of the design.
2. **Synthesis**: Converts Verilog to a hardware netlist, optimizing for area, speed, and power.

### Best Practices
1. **Signal Naming Conventions**: Use clear, consistent names for signals, ports, registers, and wires.
2. **Commenting and Documentation**: Include comments to explain the functionality and intent of the code.
3. **Avoid Latch Inference**: Ensure all control paths are covered to prevent unintended latch inference.
4. **Testing**: Develop comprehensive testbenches to verify module functionality under all scenarios.

### Common Verilog Idioms
1. **Multiplexer (MUX)**:
    - Used to select between multiple inputs based on a control signal.
  
2. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**:
    - Use `case` statements to implement state transitions.

3. **Counters and Shift Registers**:
    - Implement using simple arithmetic and bitwise operations.

### Patterns and Constructs for Specific Tasks
1. **Bitwise Operations**: Using `&`, `|`, `^`, `~` for bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
2. **Reduction Operators**: Special cases of bitwise operations that reduce to a single bit (`&`, `|`, `^`).

### Structured Information
1. **Standard Library**:
    - Maintain a library of commonly used modules (e.g., adders, multiplexers, flip-flops).

2. **Assertions and Checkers**:
    - Use assertions (`assert`) to verify assumptions within the code during simulation.

### Example Knowledge for Function Implementation
For the function `z = (x^y) & x`:
1. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Compute the bitwise exclusive OR of `x` and `y`.
2. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Compute the bitwise AND of the XOR result with `x`.

This knowledge base provides a strong foundation to facilitate the generation of robust, maintainable Verilog code tailored to a variety of design tasks.

Task:
// Module A is supposed to implement the function z = (x^y) & x. Implement this module.


module top_module (input x, input y, output z);

	// Insert your code here

endmodule
