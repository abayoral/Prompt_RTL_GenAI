### Verilog Design Knowledge Base

#### **1. Verilog Essentials**
- **Hardware Description Language (HDL)**: Verilog is a language used to describe and model electronic systems. It enables simulation before actual hardware implementation.
- **Modules**: Basic building blocks in Verilog, analogous to functions in software programming but describe hardware components. Defined with `module` and `endmodule` keywords.
- **Ports**: Interfaces for modules. Ports can be inputs, outputs, or bidirectional.
- **Always Blocks**: Used to describe behavior triggered by signal changes (`always @`). Common types include:
  - **Combinational Logic**: `always @*` or `always @(input_signals)` without using clock edges.
  - **Sequential Logic**: `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` incorporating clock and reset signals.

#### **2. State Machine (FSM) Design Principles**
- **State Encoding**: Represent states using binary encoding or one-hot encoding. Choose based on design requirements.
  - **Binary Encoding**: Fewer flip-flops, simpler, but state decoding might be more complex.
  - **One-Hot Encoding**: More flip-flops, easier state transitions as only one flip-flop changes per transition.
- **State Transition**: Defined by changes between states based on inputs and conditions.
- **Next State Logic**: Determines the next state from the current state and inputs.
- **Output Logic**: Determines the output values based on the current state and possibly the inputs.

#### **3. Best Practices in Verilog Design**
- **Reset Signal**: Always incorporate a reset mechanism, either synchronous or asynchronous, to initialize the state machine.
  - **Synchronous Reset**: Reset is triggered by the clock edge, easier for timing analysis.
  - **Asynchronous Reset**: Immediate reset, regardless of the clock, useful for hard resets.
- **State Initialization**: Ensure the FSM starts in a defined initial state (e.g., `A` state in the example).
- **Modular Design**: Break down complex designs into smaller, manageable modules.
- **Code Readability**: Use meaningful names for states, signals, and modules. Comment code appropriately to explain functionality.
- **Timing Analysis**: Ensure timing constraints are met, especially for clocked logic.

#### **4. Common Patterns in Verilog**
- **Flip-Flops**: Used to store state information, triggered on clock edges.
- **Counters**: Frequently used in state machines for timing or counting events.
- **Enumerations for States**: Use `parameter` or `localparam` to define states, improving code readability and maintainability.
  ```verilog
  localparam [1:0] A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01;
  ```
- **Case Statements**: Utilize `case` for state transitions and output logic based on the current state.
  ```verilog
  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
      if (reset)
          state <= A;
      else begin
          case (state)
              A: if (s) state <= B;
              B: if (w_count == 3) state <= A; // Example condition
              // Add other states and transitions
          endcase
      end
  end
  ```

#### **5. Example FSM Construction Steps**
- **State Definition**: Define all states required by the FSM.
- **State Register**: Store the current state, typically using a register.
- **Next State Logic**: Determine transitions between states based on current inputs.
- **Output Logic**: Define the conditions under which the output changes.
- **Clock and Reset Handling**: Ensure state transitions and outputs are synchronous with the clock, and the reset initializes the FSM correctly.

#### **6. Specific Considerations for the Given Problem**
- **Initial State (A)**: Remains in state A as long as `s = 0`. Transition to state B when `s = 1`.
- **State B Logic**: Check `w` for three clock cycles, maintaining a count of how many times `w = 1`.
- **Output z**: Set `z = 1` if `w = 1` exactly twice within the three cycles, else `z = 0`. Continue checking w in subsequent cycles.

### Conclusion
This knowledge base provides a comprehensive overview of Verilog design principles, best practices, and common patterns, which are applicable to a wide range of digital design tasks. By understanding these foundational concepts, one can effectively design and implement efficient and reliable Verilog modules for various applications.

Task:
// Consider a finite state machine with inputs s and w. Assume that the FSM begins in a reset state called A, as depicted below. The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles, then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three clock cycles, and so on. The timing diagram below illustrates the required values of z for different values of w.

// Use as few states as possible. Note that the s input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,   // Synchronous reset
    input s,
    input w,
    output z
);
	// Insert your code here

endmodule
