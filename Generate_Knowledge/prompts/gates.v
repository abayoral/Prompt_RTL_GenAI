Background Knowledge:

1. Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL): Verilog is a hardware description language used to design and document electronic systems. It is most commonly used to design digital circuits. Verilog represents a system or circuit as a set of modules, which can be interconnected to form a larger system.

2. Modularity: In Verilog, modularity is a key concept where a large system is divided into smaller, manageable modules. The designs are assembled from modules written in Verilog language. A module can represent anything from a simple gate to a more complex digital circuit.

Principles:

1. Understand Logic Gates: Logic gates form the backbone of digital design, and understanding their operation is critical to succeed in designing circuits using Verilog. The AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates should be thoroughly understood.

2. Design Hierarchically: While designing complex circuits, it's common to structure the design hierarchically. This is done by defining small, manageable blocks of the design and then combining these blocks to form a more complex system.

3. Always Test Your Design: It is very important to test your Verilog designs thoroughly. Simulate it under all possible input combinations and ensure its output is as expected.

Structured Information:

1. Modules in Verilog: A module is the smallest unit of a design in Verilog. It consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and operations defining the relationship between them.

2. Combinational Circuits: Combinational circuits are a type of digital circuit where the output solely depends on the current state of the inputs. Logic gates are examples of combinational circuits.

3. Sequential Circuits: These are circuits where the output depends not only on the present state of inputs but also on the past states. Such circuits contain memory elements.

Common Patterns:

1. Gate-Level Modeling: At this level, the design is described in terms of gates and combines AND, OR, XOR etc. logic gates.

2. Dataflow Modeling: This type of design represents the flow of data between registers and other entities in the system. The output is dependent on the value of inputs.

3. Behavioral Modeling: The most high-level and abstract method of designing with Verilog. It describes how a system operates and is used when the designer is not primarily concerned with the lower-level details of operation. 

Best Practices:

1. Use meaningful names: It's crucial to use meaningful names for inputs, outputs and modules. This makes your code more comprehensible.

2. Keep it simple: It's always best to keep designs as simple as possible. Unnecessary complexity can lead to more potential for errors.

3. Document your code: Good documentation helps other engineers understand your work, and it also helps you to understand your own work when you revisit it after a gap.

4. Modularity: Break down complex designs into smaller modules. This approach improves readability, debuggability, and reusability. 

5. Always run simulations: To validate the logic or the timing of your design, create testbenches with expected and edge case scenarios, and analyze the results for correctness.

Task:
