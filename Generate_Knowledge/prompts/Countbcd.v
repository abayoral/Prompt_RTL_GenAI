Sure! Here is a comprehensive knowledge base to aid in generating Verilog modules, with general concepts, best practices, and common patterns in Verilog design.

### General Concepts:

1. **Sequential vs. Combinational Logic:**
   - **Sequential Logic:** Depends on clock edges and previous states. It includes flip-flops, latches, and registers.
   - **Combinational Logic:** Output depends solely on the current inputs. Examples include logic gates, multiplexers, and arithmetic circuits.

2. **Basic Building Blocks:**
   - **Flip-Flop:** A basic memory element that samples its input on the edge of a clock signal.
   - **Latch:** Similar to flip-flops but level-triggered.
   - **Register:** A group of flip-flops used to store multi-bit values.

3. **Encodings and Binary Arithmetic:**
   - **BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal):** Each decimal digit is individually encoded as a four-bit binary number.
   - **Two's Complement:** A method for representing signed binary numbers.

4. **Finite State Machines (FSM):**
   - Consists of states, transitions, inputs, and outputs.
   - Used for control logic where the output depends on the current state and input.

### Best Practices:

1. **Modularity:**
   - Break down the design into smaller, reusable modules.
   - Helps in debugging and maintaining the code.

2. **Reset Signals:**
   - Use clear and consistent naming for reset signals (e.g., `reset`, `rst_n` for active-low resets).
   - Prefer synchronous resets unless an asynchronous reset is specifically required.

3. **Clock Management:**
   - Be consistent in using the clock signal, and ensure that it is clean and stable.
   - Avoid clock gating manually; instead, use enable signals.

4. **Parameterization:**
   - Use parameters and `localparam` to make the code more flexible and reusable.
   - Helps in configuring different instances of a module with varied widths or sizes without rewriting code.

5. **State Encoding:**
   - Use one-hot encoding for small FSMs and binary encoding for larger FSMs.
   - Clearly comment state transitions and state-based actions.

6. **Avoiding Race Conditions:**
   - Synchronize signals across clock domains.
   - Use registers to capture asynchronous inputs.

### Common Patterns:

1. **Counter:**
   - A basic counting mechanism to keep track of occurrences.
   - Use a combination of registers and arithmetic operations.

2. **Enable Logic:**
   - Often used in conjunction with counters to activate specific modules or logic only when certain conditions are met.
   - Can be implemented using comparators and control logic.

3. **Decade Counter:**
   - A type of counter that resets its value after reaching a specific value (e.g., 9 for BCD).

4. **Cascade Counters:**
   - Lower significant digit counters trigger higher significant digit counters.
   - Typically, a chain of smaller counters such as a multi-digit BCD counter.

### General Approach for a Multi-Digit BCD Counter:

1. **One-Digit BCD Counter:**
   - Design a module that counts from 0 to 9 and resets.
   - Include an enable signal that triggers the next significant digit counter.

2. **Chaining Counters:**
   - Instantiate single BCD counters for each digit.
   - Connect the enable signal of each significant digit to the carry-out signal of the previous less significant digit.

3. **Enable Signal:**
   - Propagate the enable signal for chain-triggering upper digit counters.
   - Ensure each enable signal is correctly synchronized with the clock.

4. **Synchronous Reset:**
   - Ensure all counters are reset correctly on a synchronous reset signal.
   - Implement the reset logic within the main module to clear all digits.

By following these guidelines and principles, you can effectively design and generate Verilog modules with improved readability, maintainability, and correctness.

Task:
// Build a 4-digit BCD (binary-coded decimal) counter. Each decimal digit is encoded using 4 bits: q[3:0] is the ones digit, q[7:4] is the tens digit, etc. For digits [3:1], also output an enable signal indicating when each of the upper three digits should be incremented.

// You may want to instantiate or modify some one-digit decade counters.

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,   // Synchronous active-high reset
    output [3:1] ena,
    output [15:0] q);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
