Background Knowledge:
1. Verilog: It's a hardware description language (HDL) used for defining and simulating digital circuits and systems. It allows engineers to describe a digital system as a set of interconnected modules with inputs, outputs, and internal behavior.

2. Module: A module in Verilog is a block of code that has a specific functionality. It is used for designing functions, registers, latches and other data paths. 

3. Data Types: There are different types of data that can be represented in Verilog like bits, integers, reals, etc. The most commonly used data types are bit vectors that are declared using [7:0] for an 8-bit vector.

4. Clock Signal: In digital circuits, a clock signal oscillates between a high and a low signal. It is used to synchronize the operations of different modules.

Principles:
1. Sequential Logic: Verilog uses sequential logic, where the output depends not only on the current inputs but also on past inputs and states.

2. Synchronization: In designing digital circuits, it's important to synchronize all operations to a clock signal to make sure every module runs in step.

3. Edge Detection: Verilog allows the detection of edges (transitions from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) in a signal. This is useful for triggering operations at specific moments in time.

Structured Information:
I. Module Construction: 
- Name: A module is first named for identification in a larger system.
- I/O Ports: The module can have input, output, or inout ports that allow it to communicate with other elements.
- Internal Implementation: The behavior of a module is defined within it using behavioral or structural modeling.

II. Clock Synchronization: 
- In Verilog, operations can be synchronized to the clock signal by using the "always @(posedge clk)" or "always @(negedge clk)" constructs.

III. Edge Detection: 
- The transition from one state to another can be detected in Verilog by saving the state and comparing it with the new incoming state after a clock cycle. To detect any edge, both positive (0 to 1) and negative (1 to 0) edges need to be considered.
  
IV. Assigning Values: 
- Assignments in Verilog are made with the "=" operator inside procedural blocks like "always". For continuous assignment, "assign" keyword is used.

V. Sensitivity List: 
- This is a list of signals that the process is sensitive to, commonly found in an "always" block. If there are changes in these signals, the process is evaluated. 

VI. Blocking vs Non-blocking Assignments: 
- Verilog supports blocking "=" and non-blocking "<=" assignments. Blocking assignment is executed in the order they are specified and subsequent statements are blocked till the current statement completes. Non-blocking assignments don't block subsequent assignments.

Best Practices:
1. Memory Elements: While designing modules, memory elements like flip-flops and latches should be designed carefully to avoid glitches and race conditions.
2. Test Bench: It's important to not just design the module but also to test the performance under different conditions.
3. Commenting: Describe the functionality and behaviour of blocks of code to increase readability and maintenance.
4. Hierarchical Design: Reusable modules should be designed hierarchically which can be reused in other parts of the design or in other projects.

Task:
// you're a senior Signal Processing Engineer at a leading hardware design company tasked with developing a critical Verilog module for a next-generation product. The success of this module is pivotal for maintaining the company's reputation in the industry.

// For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from one clock cycle to the next (detect any edge). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.
