To create a comprehensive knowledge base for generating Verilog modules, particularly focusing on finite state machines (FSM) as described in the prompt above, here is a detailed set of concepts, principles, and structured information:

### General Concepts in Verilog Design
1. **Modules**: The basic building blocks in Verilog, used to encapsulate design units. Modules can contain other modules, combinational logic, and sequential logic.
2. **Ports**: Inputs and outputs of modules. Defined using `input`, `output`, and `inout` keywords.
3. **Registers and Wires**: 
   - `wire`: Represents combinational logic connections.
   - `reg`: Used for variables that retain their value over time; typically used in always blocks.
4. **Always Blocks**: 
   - `always @ (posedge clk)`: Sequential logic block, executes on the rising edge of the clock.
   - `always @ (*)`: Combinational logic block, executes when any signal on the right-hand side changes.
5. **Initial and Assign Statements**: 
   - `initial`: Used to set initial conditions for simulations.
   - `assign`: Continuous assignment for combinational logic.
6. **Finite State Machines (FSM)**:
   - Consists of a set of states, transitions between states, input signals, and output signals.
   - Typically implemented using a state register and combinational logic for state transitions and outputs.

### Best Practices in Verilog Design
1. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Resets**:
   - Prefer synchronous reset for better timing control.
   - Clearly define the behavior during reset (output values, state initialization).
2. **State Encoding**:
   - Use enums or parameters for state encoding for readability.
   - Consider one-hot encoding for FPGA designs for simplicity and performance.
3. **Clock Domain Crossing**:
   - Use synchronizers when signals cross clock domains.
4. **Modularity**:
   - Break complex designs into smaller, manageable modules.
5. **Code Readability**:
   - Use meaningful variable and signal names.
   - Comment extensively particularly around state transitions and complex logic.
   - Use consistent indentation and formatting.

### Common Patterns in Verilog Design
1. **Counter**: Used for creating delays, timeouts, or cycle counts.
   - E.g., a simple counter can be used to monitor the `x` input for specific patterns.
2. **State Machines**: Use a combination of `always @ (posedge clk)` for updating states and combinational blocks for defining next state and outputs.
3. **Debouncers and Synchronizers**: For handling noisy or asynchronous inputs.

### Principles of FSM Implementation
1. **Define States**: Enumerate all states clearly.
   - E.g., State A, State B (monitor X), State C (assert g).
2. **State Transitions**:
   - Clearly define conditions for moving from one state to another.
   - Use case statements to manage state transitions.
3. **Output Logic**:
   - Define outputs based on current state and inputs.
4. **Synchronous Reset**:
   - Ensure the FSM starts in a known state upon reset.

### Example FSM Design Framework (Conceptual Outline)
- **State Definitions**:
  - `A`: Initial state, waiting for resetn to be de-asserted.
  - `B`: Assert `f` for one cycle.
  - `C`: Monitor `x` for the sequence 1, 0, 1.
  - `D`: Assert `g`, then monitor `y`.
  - `E`: Keep `g` asserted permanently.
  - `F`: De-assert `g` permanently if `y` does not become 1 within two cycles.

- **State Transitions**:
  - From `A` to `B` when reset is de-asserted.
  - From `B` to `C` after asserting `f`.
  - From `C` to `D` after detecting the sequence in `x`.
  - From `D` to `E` or `F` based on the value of `y`.

- **Output Logic**:
  - `f` is asserted for one cycle in state `B`.
  - `g` is asserted permanently in `E` or de-asserted permanently in `F`.

### Helpful Patterns and Constructs
1. **Case Statements**:
   - Used to define state transitions and output logic based on the current state and inputs.
2. **Registers for State and Outputs**:
   - Define `reg` variables for current state, next state, and output signals.
3. **Sequential Logic for State Update**:
   - Use a clocked always block to update the current state based on the next state.
4. **Concurrent Logic for Outputs**:
   - Use combinational logic or additional clocked always blocks to define output signals based on the state and input conditions.

### Final Note
When designing FSMs or any Verilog module, always consider edge cases, initialization, and timing constraints. Thoughtful commenting and clear signal naming go a long way in maintenance and debugging. The provided patterns and best practices are a starting point, and specific designs can be tailored based on additional requirements and constraints.

Task:
// Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input called resetn.

// The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).

// Implement the FSM

// Hint: The FSM does not begin to monitor the x input until the cycle after f is 1.

    input clk,
    input resetn,    // active-low synchronous reset
