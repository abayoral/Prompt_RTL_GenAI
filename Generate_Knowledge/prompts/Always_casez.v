### Knowledge Base for Enhancing Verilog Module Generation

#### General Concepts in Verilog
1. **Sequential and Combinational Logic**:
   - **Sequential Logic**: Implemented with flip-flops and triggered by a clock edge. Involves using `always @(posedge clock)` constructs.
   - **Combinational Logic**: Does not depend on clock signals. Implemented using continuous assignment (with `assign`) or `always @(any_change_in_signal)` blocks.

2. **Data Types**:
   - **Net Types**: `wire`, `tri`, used for connections between hardware elements.
   - **Variable Types**: `reg`, used within procedural blocks (`always`, `initial`).

3. **Operators**:
   - **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, etc.
   - **Bitwise**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`.
   - **Logical**: `&&`, `||`, `!`.
   - **Relational**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.
   - **Shift**: `<<`, `>>`.

4. **Control Structures**:
   - `if`, `else`, `case`, `for`, `while`, `repeat`.
   - Efficient use of `case` statements for handling multiple conditions.

#### Principles and Best Practices
- **Code Modularity**: Structuring code into reusable modules or functions.
- **Parameterized Modules**: Use of parameters to create flexible and reusable modules.
- **Correct Naming Conventions**: Descriptive names for signals, variables, and modules.
- **Code Readability**: Proper indentation and commenting.
- **Edge Sensitivity**: Understanding and correctly using `posedge` and `negedge`.
- **Avoiding Race Conditions**: Proper design to prevent timing issues, especially in sequential logic.

#### Common Patterns
1. **Priority Encoders**:
   - **Definition**: A circuit that encodes the position of the first high bit in the input vector.
   - **Use Case**: Simplifying the control logic by prioritizing inputs.
   - **Design Strategy**: Using nested `if` statements to check each bit in order.
   
2. **Decoders**:
   - **Definition**: A circuit that translates encoded inputs into a one-hot or binary output.
   - **Use Case**: Address decoding in memory, enabling specific actions.
   
3. **Mux/Demux**:
   - **Multiplexer**: Selects one line of data from multiple inputs.
   - **Demultiplexer**: Distributes one line of data to one of the many outputs based on select lines.

4. **State Machines**:
   - **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Models for designing sequential logic by defining states, transitions, and outputs.
   - **Use Case**: Control flows in protocols, counters, and complex logic controls.

### Structured Information
#### Priority Encoder Example General Steps
1. **Input and Output Definition**:
   - **Inputs**: An n-bit vector.
   - **Outputs**: Position of the first high bit.

2. **Basic Logic**:
   - **Input Assessment**: Create a procedural block to check each bit in the vector.
   - **Output Assignment**: Assign the output based on the position of the highest-priority active bit.
   - **Zero Case**: Ensure an output of zero if no bits are high.

3. **Procedural Block Formation**:
   - Use an `always @(*)` block for combinational logic.
   - Utilize nested `if` statements to prioritize the least significant bit.

4. **Edge Conditions**:
   - Handle edge cases like all bits being zero for a robust design.

5. **Encoding Strategy**:
   - Translate the position of the first active bit into binary representation.

### Example Conceptual Plan (NOT CODE)
1. **Declare Priority Encoder Module**.
2. **Define Input and Output Ports**.
3. **Initialize Procedural Block for Combinational Logic**.
4. **Create Nested `if` or `case` Statements**:
   - Check each bit from the most significant to the least significant.
   - Assign position value accordingly.
5. **Handle All Zeros Case**:
   - Default the output to zero if no bits are set.
6. **Validate Design Functionality**:
   - Ensure correct encoding for various test vectors.

By following these guidelines and understanding these principles, a language model can enhance its capability to generate efficient and correct Verilog modules across various design tasks.

Task:
// Build a priority encoder for 8-bit inputs. Given an 8-bit vector, 
// the output should report the first (least significant) bit in the vector that is 1. 
// Report zero if the input vector has no bits that are high. 
// For example, the input 8'b10010000 should output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high.
