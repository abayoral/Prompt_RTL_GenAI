Background Knowledge:

1. **Verilog:** Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It describes the behavior and structure of system and circuit designs.

2. **FPGA:** Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a designer or a customer after manufacturing.

3. **Module:** In Verilog, a module is the largest organizational unit, equivalent to a function in C/C++, which may contain other modules, specifications of inputs/outputs (I/O), and assignments.

4. **Shift Register:** A shift register is a type of sequential logic circuit mainly used for the storage of digital data. Its operation is to shift the binary information in either left or right direction under the control of a clock.

5. **MUXDFF Subcircuit:** A MUXDFF is a multiplexer that is followed by a D flip-flop. It's often used in digital circuit design.

Principles:

1. **Modular Design:** It's crucial to keep architectural modularity in Verilog designs. Modular design not only makes the code easier to read and debug but also promotes reuse.

2. **Proper Instantiation:** Each copy of a module/subcircuit must be properly instantiated with clear, sensible names, allowing easy tracking of signals and debugging.

3. **I/O Connection:** Input and output ports should be precisely connected to match module design signals.

4. **Proper Synchronisation and Control:** The use of synchronous design, where elements are driven by a common clock signal, reduces data corruption due to setup and hold time issues.

Structured information:

1. **Defining a Module**: Every hardware part in Verilog is defined by a module. A module can include inputs, outputs, and internal wires or registers.

2. **Module Instantiation**: Within another module, a module can be instantiated multiple times, each referred to as an instance of that module.

3. **Signal Connection**: Proper connection of signals to input, output, and internal components of each module is imperative for preventing bugs or irregular behaviour in the system design.

4. **Control Elements**: Verilog designs often have control elements like switches and keys. It is vital to be clear about the function of these elements and make sure that they are correctly interconnected in the Verilog design.

5. **Interfacing with Hardware**: Practice interfacing your Verilog code with different hardware components like LEDs, Switches, etc. to better understand how to control and manipulate these elements using Verilog code. 

6. **Sequential Logic Design**: Understanding the principles of sequential logic design, including functionality of storage devices like flip-flops and shift registers, is essential for robust and functional designs.

Task:
// you're a senior FPGA Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company tasked with developing a critical Verilog module for a next-generation product. The success of this module is pivotal for maintaining the company's reputation in the industry.

// Write a top-level Verilog module (named top_module) for the shift register, assuming that n = 4. Instantiate four copies of your MUXDFF subcircuit in your top-level module. Assume that you are going to implement the circuit on the DE2 board.

// Connect the R inputs to the SW switches,
// clk to KEY[0],
// E to KEY[1],
// L to KEY[2], and
// w to KEY[3].
// Connect the outputs to the red lights LEDR[3:0].

module top_module (
    input [3:0] SW,
    input [3:0] KEY,
    output [3:0] LEDR
); //
