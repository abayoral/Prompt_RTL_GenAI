### Verilog Knowledge Base

#### 1. Fundamentals of Verilog
- **Verilog Overview**: Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It allows for both behavior and structural modeling.
- **Modules**: The basic building block in Verilog is the module, which encapsulates design logic.
- **Ports**: Modules communicate with other modules using ports (input, output, and inout).

#### 2. Basic Concepts
- **Nets and Variables**:
  - Nets (`wire`): Represent physical connections between hardware elements.
  - Variables (`reg`, `logic`): Hold data values and can be used in procedural blocks.

- **Assignments**:
  - Continuous Assignments: Used for combinational logic (`assign` statement).
  - Procedural Assignments: Used within `always` blocks.

#### 3. Procedural Blocks
- **Always Blocks**:
  - `always @(posedge clk)` or `always @(negedge clk)`: Triggered on clock edges, typical for sequential logic.
  - `always @(*)`: Used for combinational logic and triggered whenever any of the inputs change.

- **Initial Blocks**: Used for initial setups like testbenches and simulation-specific code.

#### 4. Sequential Logic
- **Flip-flops**:
  - D Flip-flops: Store the value of an input (`d`) on the rising or falling edge of a clock signal (`clk`).
  - T Flip-flops, JK Flip-flops, etc.: Variants used for specific applications.

- **Non-blocking Assignments (`<=`)**:
  - Used in sequential logic to avoid race conditions. It ensures all assignments happen concurrently.
  
- **Blocking Assignments (`=`)**:
  - Used in combinational logic within `always` blocks.

#### 5. Combinational Logic
- **Continuous Assignment**: Use `assign` statements for combinational logic outside procedural blocks.
- **Procedural Blocks**: Use `always @(*)` for combinational logic inside procedural blocks.

#### 6. Finite State Machines (FSM)
- **FSMs**:
  - **Moore Machine**: Outputs depend only on the current state.
  - **Mealy Machine**: Outputs depend on both the current state and input.

- **State Encoding**: Binary, One-hot, Gray encoding.

#### 7. Best Practices
- **Code Readability**:
  - Use meaningful names for signals and modules.
  - Comment code to explain the functionality.
  
- **Clock Domain Crossing**:
  - Use synchronization techniques when dealing with multiple clock domains.

- **Reset Signals**:
  - Provide proper reset initialization for sequential circuits.
  - Choose between synchronous and asynchronous resets as needed.

- **Simulation and Synthesis**:
  - Ensure code is synthesizable if the target is hardware implementation.
  - Use testbenches to verify functionality through simulation.

#### 8. Common Patterns in Verilog Design
- **Debouncing Buttons**: Use counters to filter out mechanical bounce noise.
- **Synchronizers**: Use flip-flops in series to synchronize signals between different clock domains.
- **Edge Detection**: Detect rising and falling edges of signals using flip-flops.
- **Clock Dividers**: Use counters to create slower clocks from the main clock.

#### 9. Debugging Techniques
- **Waveform Analysis**: Use waveform viewers to inspect the behavior of signals over time.
- **Assertions**: Check assumptions about your design during simulation.
- **Testbenches**: Create thorough testbenches to validate your design under various conditions.

This knowledge base provides a robust framework for generating Verilog modules, ensuring that the design adheres to best practices, and is both functional and maintainable.

Task:
// Create a single D flip-flop.

module top_module (
    input clk,    // Clocks are used in sequential circuits
    input d,
    output reg q );//

    // Use a clocked always block
    //   copy d to q at every positive edge of clk
    //   Clocked always blocks should use non-blocking assignments

endmodule
