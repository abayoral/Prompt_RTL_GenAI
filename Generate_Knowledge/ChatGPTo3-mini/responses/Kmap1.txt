    // After analyzing the Karnaugh map:
    // The K-map covers all combinations of a, b, and c and all cells are 1.
    // This means that no matter what the input values are, the output is always 1.
    // Both the Sum-of-Products (SOP) simplification and the Product-of-Sums (POS) form
    // reduce to 1. Thus, the simplified circuit is simply:
    
    assign out = 1'b1;
