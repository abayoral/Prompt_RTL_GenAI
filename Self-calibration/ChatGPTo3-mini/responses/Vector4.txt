The provided Verilog module is already correct. It uses the replication operator to extend the sign bit (in[7]) 24 times and concatenates this with the original 8‐bit vector to produce a 32‐bit output, which is exactly how sign extension is typically implemented.

For clarity and best practices, you might consider adding some comments or formatting improvements. Here's the same module with some added commentary and slight formatting adjustments:

-------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  [7:0]  in,
    output [31:0] out
);

    // Sign-extend the 8-bit input to 32 bits.
    // The most significant bit (in[7]) is replicated 24 times,
    // then concatenated with the original 8 bits.
    assign out = { {24{in[7]}}, in };

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------

No functional, logical, or syntax errors were identified, so this cleaned-up version adheres to best practices while maintaining the original intended behavior.
