The code you provided is functionally correct and synthesizes as expected. It compares the 2‚Äêbit inputs A and B and assigns the resulting Boolean value to output z. However, a few minor improvements can be made to adhere to best practices and ensure clarity:

1. It is good practice to explicitly designate the output as a wire when using continuous assignments.
2. Adding appropriate formatting and comments can improve code readability.

Below is the revised version with these improvements:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  [1:0] A,    // 2-bit input A
    input  [1:0] B,    // 2-bit input B
    output wire  z     // 1-bit output indicating A equals B
);

    // Compare A and B. The output z is high when A equals B.
    assign z = (A == B);

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

This version is equivalent in functionality to your original code while explicitly declaring the output as a wire and including comments, which is a recommended style in verification and design environments.
