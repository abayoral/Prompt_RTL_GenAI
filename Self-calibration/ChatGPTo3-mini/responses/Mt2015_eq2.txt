The provided code is functionally correct. In this module, the expression (A == B) compares the two 2-bit values and returns a 1‚Äêbit Boolean result that is assigned to z. There are no syntax or logical errors in the code.

That said, if you wish to adhere to best practices, you might consider the following optional enhancements:

1. Explicitly declare the output type as a wire (although by default, module outputs are nets, which are wires unless otherwise specified).
2. Add a timescale directive if this module will be simulated.
3. Include a brief comment about the module functionality.

Below is the enhanced version incorporating these suggestions:

-----------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns/1ps
module top_module (
    input  [1:0] A,
    input  [1:0] B,
    output wire  z           // z is high when A equals B
);

    assign z = (A == B);  // Compare A and B

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------

Feel free to use the original code if you do not require these additional details, as it already meets functional requirements.
