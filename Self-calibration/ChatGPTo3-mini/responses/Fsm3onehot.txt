Below is a corrected and slightly cleaned‐up version. Functionally nothing major needed to be changed because the original code was synthesizable and logically correct. In the revised version I’ve changed the state constants to localparams (which is a good practice when you want constants scoped locally) and kept the combinational assignments. Note, however, that this module produces pure combinational next‐state logic and does not store state (i.e. there is no register); this is appropriate if you are generating the next state in a one‐hot FSM but then will register it elsewhere.

-----------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input        in,
    input  [3:0] state,
    output [3:0] next_state,
    output       out
);

    // Define state indices as local parameters
    localparam A = 0;
    localparam B = 1;
    localparam C = 2;
    localparam D = 3;

    // Next state logic for one-hot encoded state machine
    // For state A: transitions from A and C when in is 0.
    assign next_state[A] = ~in & (state[A] | state[C]);
    // For state B: transitions from A, B, and D when in is 1.
    assign next_state[B] = in & (state[A] | state[B] | state[D]);
    // For state C: transitions from B and D when in is 0.
    assign next_state[C] = ~in & (state[B] | state[D]);
    // For state D: transition from C when in is 1.
    assign next_state[D] = in & state[C];

    // Moore output logic: output is 1 only in state D.
    assign out = state[D];

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------

Key points addressed:
1. Changed parameters to localparams to restrict their scope.
2. Left the combinational assignments intact (since in a one‐hot FSM, each bit of next_state is computed separately).
3. Comments clarify the intended FSM transitions.

This version adheres to best practices while remaining functionally equivalent to your original design.
