Below is the corrected module. The only error in the original code was in the logic for next_state[B]. According to the state transition table, next_state[B] should be activated when:

 • The current state is A and in==1 (transition A → B)  
 • The current state is B and in==1 (remain in B)  
 • The current state is D and in==1 (transition D → B)

The original code only included state[B] and state[D] in the OR‐term. The corrected code adds state[A] so that the A → B transition is properly handled. In addition, best practice is to use localparam for constant state names. Here is the corrected version:

-------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input        in,
    input  [3:0] state,      // one-hot encoded state; only one bit high
    output [3:0] next_state, // one-hot encoded next state
    output       out         // Moore output
);

    // Define state indices using one-hot encoding:
    // A = bit 0, B = bit 1, C = bit 2, D = bit 3
    localparam A = 0,
               B = 1,
               C = 2,
               D = 3;

    // Next state logic based on the state transition table:
    // From state A: if in==0 -> remain in A; if in==1 -> go to B.
    // From state B: if in==0 -> go to C; if in==1 -> remain in B.
    // From state C: if in==0 -> go to A; if in==1 -> go to D.
    // From state D: if in==0 -> go to C; if in==1 -> go to B.
    
    // next_state[A] is activated if either:
    //   - current state is A and in==0, or
    //   - current state is C and in==0.
    assign next_state[A] = ~in & (state[A] | state[C]);
    
    // next_state[B] is activated if any of the following are true:
    //   - current state is A and in==1 (transition A -> B),
    //   - current state is B and in==1 (remain in B), or
    //   - current state is D and in==1 (transition D -> B).
    assign next_state[B] = in & (state[A] | state[B] | state[D]);
    
    // next_state[C] is activated if either:
    //   - current state is B and in==0, or
    //   - current state is D and in==0.
    assign next_state[C] = ~in & (state[B] | state[D]);
    
    // next_state[D] is activated only if:
    //   - current state is C and in==1.
    assign next_state[D] = in & state[C];
    
    // Moore machine output is determined solely by the current state.
    // The output is 1 only if the current state is D.
    assign out = state[D];

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Changes:

1. Changed parameter declarations to localparam for better synthesis practices.
2. Corrected the next_state[B] assignment by adding state[A] to account for the transition from state A to B when in==1.

This updated module now accurately implements the specified state transitions using one‑hot encoding and follows good Verilog coding practices.
