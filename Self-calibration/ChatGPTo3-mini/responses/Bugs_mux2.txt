The provided code is functionally correct and synthesizes as intended. It simply selects between the two 8‐bit inputs based on the value of “sel”. There are no syntax or logical errors.

That said, here’s a slightly enhanced version following common best practices (like explicitly declaring the signal types):

----------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module top_module (
    input  wire       sel,
    input  wire [7:0] a,
    input  wire [7:0] b,
    output wire [7:0] out
);

    // Using a continuous assignment with the ternary operator.
    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
----------------------------------------------------

This version explicitly declares the input and output as wires, and includes a timescale directive which is common for simulation. If you intend to use this design in your project, it should work correctly.
