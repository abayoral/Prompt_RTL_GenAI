The design you provided is functionally correct and synthesizes as expected. There are no logical, syntax, or functional errors in terms of Verilog language rules. That said, we can make a few adjustments to adhere more closely to best practices commonly seen in modern Verilog/SystemVerilog coding. For example:

• Use the SystemVerilog “logic” type for signals (if your tool supports it).  
• Use always_comb (or always @(*) in traditional Verilog) to clearly indicate combinational logic.  
• Either drive the output directly in the always block or use an intermediate signal as you did.  

Below is a revised version of your module that implements these suggestions. (Note: The module my_dff8 is assumed to be defined elsewhere.)

---------------- Corrected Version ----------------
  
module top_module (
    input  logic        clk,
    input  logic [7:0]  d,
    input  logic [1:0]  sel,
    output logic [7:0]  q
);

    // Internal signals for pipeline stages
    logic [7:0] stage1;
    logic [7:0] stage2;
    logic [7:0] stage3;
    
    // Instantiate three 8-bit D flip-flops
    my_dff8 dff1 (
        .clk(clk),
        .d(d),
        .q(stage1)
    );
    
    my_dff8 dff2 (
        .clk(clk),
        .d(stage1),
        .q(stage2)
    );
    
    my_dff8 dff3 (
        .clk(clk),
        .d(stage2),
        .q(stage3)
    );
    
    // Multiplexer: choose the output depending on the value of sel.
    // Using an always_comb block to infer pure combinational logic.
    always_comb begin
        case (sel)
            2'b00: q = d;       // immediate input
            2'b01: q = stage1;  // after 1st flip-flop
            2'b10: q = stage2;  // after 2nd flip-flop
            2'b11: q = stage3;  // after 3rd flip-flop
            default: q = 8'b0;   // safety default (not strictly necessary for 2-bit sel)
        endcase
    end

endmodule

-----------------------------------------------------

Key points in the revised version:
1. The use of "logic" instead of "wire" or "reg" is more idiomatic in SystemVerilog.
2. The combinational logic is assigned directly to the output q within an always_comb block rather than passing through an intermediary register and then an assign statement.
3. The case statement covers all values of a 2-bit input, so the default is typically unnecessary but is included as a safe coding practice.

This version is functionally equivalent to your original code but follows modern coding guidelines for clarity and maintainability.
