Below is a revised version of the module. In our review we found that although the overall functionality was acceptable, the code declared an unused next‐state variable and did not separate the combinational next–state logic from the sequential state update. (Also, a more “best practice” style is to write clear comments and use a consistent coding style even in simple FSMs.) The following version removes the unused variable and rewrites the FSM with clear, commented sections. Note that this simple design assumes that the incoming serial data is sampled at the proper time (e.g. mid–bit); in a complete design you would typically include baud rate generation and oversampling.

------------------------------------------------------------

Key changes and notes:

1. Removed the unused "next_state" register.
2. Kept the reset synchronous (as noted) and ensured all registers are initialized on reset.
3. Added comments for clarity.
4. Retained the simple FSM structure; for more robust implementations (e.g., UART reception) you might include edge/baud–rate sampling and use a separate combinational block to compute next_state.

This revised version adheres to a clearer coding style and better best practices while achieving the intended functionality.
