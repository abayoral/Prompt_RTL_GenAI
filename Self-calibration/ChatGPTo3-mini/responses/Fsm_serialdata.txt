Below is one corrected and slightly improved version of the module. Key changes include:

• Clarifying the bit counter width (using 3 bits since only 8 data bits need to be counted, 0–7) and updating the related condition.  
• In the RECV state, the shift and counter update have been re‐organized so that the final bit is processed correctly before moving to the STOP state. This removes any potential confusion with nonblocking assignments.  
• Minor comment and style improvements have been made.  

Here is the revised code:

-----------------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [7:0] out_byte,
    output done
);

    // State declaration
    localparam IDLE  = 2'b00,
               RECV  = 2'b01,
               STOP  = 2'b10;

    reg [1:0] state;
    reg [2:0] bit_counter; // 3-bit counter: counts 0 to 7 for 8 data bits
    reg [7:0] shift_reg;   // register to store incoming bits
    reg [7:0] out_reg;     // registered output byte
    reg done_reg;

    assign out_byte = out_reg;
    assign done = done_reg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state       <= IDLE;
            bit_counter <= 3'd0;
            shift_reg   <= 8'd0;
            out_reg     <= 8'd0;
            done_reg    <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            // Default: Clear done signal except when explicitly set.
            done_reg <= 1'b0;
            case (state)
                IDLE: begin
                    // Waiting for a start bit. (Start bit should be 0.)
                    if (in == 1'b0) begin
                        bit_counter <= 3'd0;
                        // Optionally clear shift_reg if desired.
                        shift_reg   <= 8'd0;
                        state       <= RECV;
                    end
                end

                RECV: begin
                    // Sample incoming bit and shift it into the correct position.
                    // Protocol sends LSB first.
                    shift_reg[bit_counter] <= in;
                    if (bit_counter == 3'd7) begin
                        // After receiving the 8th data bit, move to STOP state.
                        state <= STOP;
                    end else begin
                        bit_counter <= bit_counter + 1'b1;
                    end
                end

                STOP: begin
                    // Check for a valid stop bit (should be high).
                    if (in == 1'b1) begin
                        out_reg  <= shift_reg; // Latch the received data.
                        done_reg <= 1'b1;       // Signal that a complete byte is received.
                        state    <= IDLE;
                    end
                    // If in is not high, the state machine remains in STOP until a valid stop bit is detected.
                end

                default: state <= IDLE;
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Corrections and Improvements:

1. Bit Counter Width:  
   Since only 8 data bits are received (bits 0–7), using a 3‑bit counter is sufficient and avoids ambiguity in the comments.

2. RECV State Logic:  
   The code now updates the counter only if the current data bit is not the last one. This ensures that the last data bit is stored correctly before transitioning to the STOP state.

3. Comments and Style:  
   Minor adjustments to comments clarify the operation of each state and the expected protocol (start bit = 0, stop bit = 1). The default assignment to done_reg ensures that the done pulse lasts only one clock cycle.

This revised module follows standard best practices while maintaining the intended functionality of receiving a serial byte with start, data, and stop bits.
