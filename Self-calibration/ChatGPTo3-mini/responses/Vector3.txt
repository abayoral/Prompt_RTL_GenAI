Below is one acceptable corrected version. Note that the original code is functionally correct (the six 5‐bit inputs plus two 1’s do indeed make 32 bits when concatenated and then split into four 8‐bit pieces), but we can improve the style and clarity by declaring each port on its own line and by using an internal wire for the combined 32‐bit vector. One thing you may wish to check is whether the two constant 1’s should be the most significant bits or the least significant bits. (In your code, they’re placed as the LSBs.) If that is the intent, then the following code is acceptable. Otherwise, just change the order in the concatenation. 

Below is the improved version:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  [4:0] a,
    input  [4:0] b,
    input  [4:0] c,
    input  [4:0] d,
    input  [4:0] e,
    input  [4:0] f,
    output [7:0] w,
    output [7:0] x,
    output [7:0] y,
    output [7:0] z
);

    // Concatenate the six 5-bit inputs (30 bits)
    // with two constant 1's (2 bits) to form a 32-bit vector.
    // Note: In this code the two constants become the least significant bits.
    wire [31:0] combined = {a, b, c, d, e, f, 1'b1, 1'b1};

    // Split the 32-bit word into four 8-bit outputs.
    // The most significant 8 bits go to w.
    assign {w, x, y, z} = combined;

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

If you intended the constant 1’s to be the most significant bits, simply change the concatenation line to:

    wire [31:0] combined = {1'b1, 1'b1, a, b, c, d, e, f};

This corrected module now adheres to best practices for clarity and maintainability, while still meeting the original functionality.
