Below is an analysis and a revised solution.

1. Analysis of the Original Code

a) Dual‐edge–triggered logic and OR’ing clocks:
 • The original code uses two always blocks – one on clk’s rising edge and one on clk’s falling edge – each generating an auxiliary clock (clk_div1, clk_div2) and then OR’ing them together.
 • Although this “double‐edge” approach might seem to “average” the toggling to produce a near–50% duty cycle, using both posedge and negedge logic in a design is generally discouraged:
  – It may not be supported by all synthesis tools or FPGAs.
  – Combining asynchronously generated signals with a simple OR can lead to glitches and unpredictable timing.
 
b) Division logic for odd numbers:
 • Dividing by an odd number is inherently “asymmetric” (one edge period will be one clk cycle longer than the other). A well–tested solution is to use a single–edge design that toggles the output at two different counter values: one at the “half–period” count and one at the end of the period.
 
c) Best practice:
 • It is preferable to use a single always block triggered on a single clock edge. One common technique for an odd divider is to maintain a counter (from 0 to NUM_DIV–1) and toggle the output when the counter equals (NUM_DIV–1)/2 and again when the counter reaches NUM_DIV–1. This produces an output clock whose high/low times differ by one clk cycle (which is inevitable for odd division).

2. Corrected Version

Below is the revised module using a single always block with only the rising edge used. This design avoids asynchronous OR’ing of two clocks and is far more robust for synthesis and simulation. Comments explain the operation:

------------------------------------------------------------
module freq_divbyodd #(
    parameter NUM_DIV = 5  // Divide-by-odd number; e.g., for NUM_DIV=5 the output clock period = 5 cycles (with duty-cycle ≠ 50%)
)(
    input  clk,       // Primary clock
    input  rst_n,     // Asynchronous active-low reset
    output reg clk_div // Divided clock output
);

    // Calculate counter width – enough to count from 0 to NUM_DIV-1.
    localparam CNT_WIDTH = $clog2(NUM_DIV);

    // Counter register.
    reg [CNT_WIDTH-1:0] cnt;

    // Note: For an odd number division the output clock’s high and low phases will be asymmetric.
    // When NUM_DIV = 5, for example, one phase will be 3 cycles and the other 2 cycles.
    // We toggle clk_div at both (NUM_DIV-1)/2 and NUM_DIV-1.
    //
    // Operation:
    //   - When the counter reaches (NUM_DIV-1)/2, toggle clk_div.
    //   - When the counter reaches NUM_DIV-1, toggle clk_div again and reset the counter.
    // This produces a divided clock with the correct period.
    
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            cnt     <= 0;
            clk_div <= 1'b0;
        end 
        else begin
            // If counter reaches the maximum count
            if (cnt == NUM_DIV - 1) begin
                cnt     <= 0;
                clk_div <= ~clk_div;
            end
            else begin
                cnt <= cnt + 1;
                // Toggle the output at the halfway count.
                // Using integer division: (NUM_DIV-1)/2 yields the lower half point for odd NUM_DIV.
                if (cnt == (NUM_DIV - 1) / 2)
                    clk_div <= ~clk_div;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule

3. Explanation

• We now have one always block triggered on the rising edge of clk.
• The counter (cnt) counts from 0 up to NUM_DIV–1.
• When cnt equals (NUM_DIV-1)/2 (the “middle” of the period), we toggle clk_div.
• When cnt reaches NUM_DIV–1, we toggle clk_div again and reset the counter.
• This single edge–triggered scheme avoids combining asynchronous signals and is much friendlier for synthesis.
• The output clock will have a period of NUM_DIV cycles; note that for odd division the duty cycle will not be 50% (which is unavoidable).

4. Conclusion

The revised module eliminates the potential glitches of dual–edge–triggering and asynchronous OR’ing. It adheres to best practices by using a single always block and produces a correct divided clock for an odd division factor.
