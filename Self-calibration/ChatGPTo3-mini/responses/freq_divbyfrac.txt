Below is one “corrected‐and improved” version of the design. In our review we found two issues:

1. Although the original code “works” at a behavioral level, combining two asynchronous clock branches (one triggered on the positive clock edge and one on the negative edge) with a combinational OR is not a best practice. In many target technologies (for example, FPGA clock networks) it may lead to glitches and clock‐skew issues. (If the intent is to “create” a new clock by combining two asynchronous signals it is usually better to use a PLL/clock‐manager, or – if that isn’t available – to generate a “divided‐clock” signal that is used as an enable for logic in a single clock domain rather than as an actual clock distribution.)

2. While the “fractions” are implemented as described, it is usually safer to “synchronize” the resulting clock signal to the source clock. (A small register stage is often added so that glitches on the asynchronous OR do not propagate.)

One way to fix these issues while staying “close” to the original design is to generate the two branches as before and then register their OR result. (Note that this does not solve all issues with using a gated clock elsewhere – it only makes the output signal behave more like a synchronous logic signal suitable as a clock-enable signal inside your design.)

Below is the revised Verilog code:

---------------------------------------------------------------
module freq_divbyfrac (
    input  wire clk,    // Main clock input
    input  wire rst_n,  // Active‐low reset
    output wire clk_div // Divided clock output (approximately clk/3.5)
);

  // -----------------------------------------------------------
  // Positive–edge branch: generates an intermediate clock (pos_ff)
  // This branch toggles every 4 rising edges of clk.
  // -----------------------------------------------------------
  reg [2:0] pos_cnt;
  reg       pos_ff;

  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      pos_cnt <= 3'd0;
      pos_ff  <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      if (pos_cnt == 3'd3) begin
        pos_ff  <= ~pos_ff;
        pos_cnt <= 3'd0;
      end else begin
        pos_cnt <= pos_cnt + 1'b1;
      end
    end
  end
  
  // -----------------------------------------------------------
  // Negative–edge branch: generates an intermediate clock (neg_ff)
  // This branch toggles every 3 falling edges of clk.
  // -----------------------------------------------------------
  reg [1:0] neg_cnt;
  reg       neg_ff;

  always @(negedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      neg_cnt <= 2'd0;
      neg_ff  <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      if (neg_cnt == 2'd2) begin
        neg_ff  <= ~neg_ff;
        neg_cnt <= 2'd0;
      end else begin
        neg_cnt <= neg_cnt + 1'b1;
      end
    end
  end

  // -----------------------------------------------------------
  // Combine both phase–shifted signals.
  // Note: This combinational OR produces clk_div_raw, but since the
  // two branches are asynchronous relative to one another, this signal
  // may glitch. In order to “clean” it up, we register the combined result.
  // The effective toggling rate is approximately that of a clock with a period
  // of 7 main clock cycles, i.e. an average division factor of 3.5.
  // -----------------------------------------------------------
  wire clk_div_raw;
  assign clk_div_raw = pos_ff | neg_ff;

  reg clk_div_reg;
  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n)
      clk_div_reg <= 1'b0;
    else
      clk_div_reg <= clk_div_raw;
  end

  assign clk_div = clk_div_reg;
  
endmodule
---------------------------------------------------------------

Notes on the changes and recommendations:

• We have added a register stage on the OR-ed output so that the output (clk_div) is synchronized to the main clock domain. This minimizes glitch problems that might arise from combining asynchronous signals.

• Although this technique “divides” the frequency by 3.5 on average, using separate positive and negative edge–triggered always blocks is not common practice for clock generation in production designs. In safety– or timing–critical designs it is recommended to use an appropriate clock management solution (e.g. PLL or dedicated clock divider) rather than generating a derived clock by gating asynchronous signals.

This revised version conforms to typical best practices for writing safe, synthesizable Verilog while implementing the intended frequency division.
