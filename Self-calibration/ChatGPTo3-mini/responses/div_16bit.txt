Below is a corrected, cleaned‐up version of the module. In the original code the main issues were:

1. Two separate always blocks were used to “capture” the inputs into internal registers before doing the computation. For a purely combinational division algorithm this extra copying is unnecessary. It is clearer and less error prone to work directly with the input signals.

2. There was no protection for the case when the divisor is zero. (Division by 0 is undefined so it is good practice to provide a defined behavior, such as returning a special error code, a maximum value, or simply the dividend as remainder.)  
 
3. The output named “odd” is not an intuitive name for the remainder. Renaming it to “remainder” improves readability.  
 
Below is one corrected version that adheres to best practices. (Of course, the “zero‐divisor” behavior can be adjusted to meet your requirements.)

module div_16bit (
    input  [15:0] A,       // 16-bit dividend
    input  [7:0]  B,       // 8-bit divisor
    output reg [15:0] quotient,  // 16-bit quotient
    output reg [15:0] remainder  // 16-bit remainder
);

    integer i;
    reg [15:0] temp_q; // Temporary quotient
    reg [15:0] temp_r; // Temporary remainder (accumulator)

    // Combinational division: perform the shift/subtract algorithm.
    always @(*) begin
        // Check for a zero divisor. Modify this behavior if desired.
        if (B == 0) begin
            quotient  = 16'hFFFF;  // Return a special value for an undefined quotient
            remainder = A;         // And pass the dividend as the remainder.
        end
        else begin
            temp_q = 16'b0;
            temp_r = 16'b0;
            // Process each bit of the dividend starting from the MSB.
            for(i = 15; i >= 0; i = i - 1) begin
                // Shift left the remainder and bring in A[i].
                temp_r = {temp_r[14:0], A[i]};
                // Compare with the divisor (after extending B to 16-bits).
                if(temp_r >= {8'b0, B}) begin
                    temp_r = temp_r - {8'b0, B};
                    temp_q[i] = 1'b1;
                end
                else begin
                    temp_q[i] = 1'b0;
                end
            end
            quotient  = temp_q;
            remainder = temp_r;
        end
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

Key changes:
• The extra always block (used to copy A and B to internal registers) has been removed.
• Inputs A and B are used directly, which simplifies the design.
• A check for B == 0 has been added. You can adjust the “zero divisor” behavior if needed.
• The output “odd” has been renamed to “remainder” for clarity.

This revision adheres to best practices in synthesizable combinational logic design.
