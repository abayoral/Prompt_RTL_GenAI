Below is an improved version of the code. In the original code the division algorithm was essentially correct; however, there were a few issues that we can clean up:

1. Two separate always blocks were used to “register” A and B, only to use them immediately in the combinational division block. For a purely combinational divider, it’s simpler (and clearer) to work directly with the inputs.

2. The signal name “odd” for the remainder is a bit misleading. (It is common practice to call it “remainder”.) We’ve renamed it accordingly.

3. It is often a good idea to handle the divisor being zero. In the updated version a simple “if (B == 0)” check sets the quotient to a safe value (here we set all bits, but you might choose another convention) while passing through the dividend as the remainder.

4. Finally, the two always blocks were merged into a single always-block. This avoids unnecessary replication of combinational logic and follows best coding practices.

Below is the corrected, best‐practice version:

---------------------------------------------------
module div_16bit(
    input  [15:0] A,
    input  [7:0]  B,
    output reg [15:0] result,    // quotient
    output reg [15:0] remainder  // remainder
);

    integer i;
    reg [15:0] q_temp;  // Temporary quotient
    reg [15:0] r_temp;  // Temporary remainder

    always @(*) begin
        // Handle division by zero as a safe operation.
        if (B == 8'b0) begin
            // You may choose other behavior (such as setting an error flag).
            result    = 16'hFFFF;
            remainder = A;
        end else begin
            // Initialize quotient and remainder.
            q_temp  = 16'b0;
            r_temp  = 16'b0;
            // Perform iterative division: process from MSB (bit 15) to LSB (bit 0)
            for (i = 15; i >= 0; i = i - 1) begin
                // Shift the remainder left and bring in the next bit of the dividend.
                r_temp = {r_temp[14:0], A[i]};
                // Extend the 8-bit divisor to 16 bits and compare.
                if (r_temp >= {8'b0, B}) begin
                    r_temp = r_temp - {8'b0, B};
                    q_temp[i] = 1'b1;
                end
                else begin
                    q_temp[i] = 1'b0;
                end
            end
            // Assign the computed quotient and remainder.
            result    = q_temp;
            remainder = r_temp;
        end
    end

endmodule
---------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Corrections:

• Combined the two always blocks into one so that the inputs can be used directly.
• Renamed “odd” to “remainder” for clarity.
• Added an “if (B==0)” branch to handle division-by-zero gracefully.
• Retained the standard iterative (shift-subtract) division algorithm.

This version adheres to best practices and ensures that the division operation is both clear and robust.
