Below is one acceptable corrected version. In our “fixed‐up” code we make the following improvements:

1. We move the “next accumulator” computation into a combinational block (a reg computed inside an always @(*) block) so that its intent is clearer. (Although the original “wire next_accum” was not technically wrong, it can sometimes be confusing when used with nonblocking assignments that update the registers on the same clock edge.)  
2. We add comments and slightly reorganize the always block so that the idle (new multiplication) and busy (iterative multiply) conditions are clearly separated.  
3. We use proper nonblocking assignments for all sequential updates.

Because the original iterative multiplier was already “almost correct” (there were no syntax mistakes), there is some latitude in how to “fix” it. The following version is completely equivalent in function (performing an 8‐cycle shift-and-add multiplication) but follows best practices a bit more closely.

module multi_8bit(
    input        clk,
    input        rst,
    input  [7:0] A,
    input  [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] product
);

  // Internal registers for iterative multiplication.
  reg [15:0] accum;         // Running sum
  reg [15:0] multiplicand;  // Shifted version of multipicand
  reg [7:0]  multiplier;    // Copy of multiplier
  reg [3:0]  count;         // Iteration counter (0-7)
  reg        busy;          // Indicates multiplication in progress

  // Combinational logic: Compute what the next accumulator value should be.
  // This depends on the LSB of multiplier.
  reg [15:0] next_accum;
  always @(*) begin
     next_accum = accum + (multiplier[0] ? multiplicand : 16'd0);
  end
  
  // On reset, clear all registers. Otherwise, when not busy, latch inputs
  // and start the iterative process. Each cycle, perform one iteration.
  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
      busy         <= 1'b0;
      count        <= 4'd0;
      accum        <= 16'd0;
      multiplicand <= 16'd0;
      multiplier   <= 8'd0;
      product      <= 16'd0;
    end else begin
      if (!busy) begin
        // Start a new multiplication: latch the inputs.
        busy         <= 1'b1;
        count        <= 4'd0;
        accum        <= 16'd0;
        multiplicand <= {8'd0, A};  // Zero-extend the 8-bit input A.
        multiplier   <= B;
      end else begin
        // Perform one iterative cycle: accumulate if needed, then shift.
        accum        <= next_accum;
        multiplicand <= multiplicand << 1;
        multiplier   <= multiplier >> 1;
        
        if (count == 4'd7) begin
          // After the 8th iteration, finish the multiplication.
          product <= next_accum; // Use the final computed value.
          busy    <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
          count <= count + 1;
        end
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the main points:

• When rst is asserted the module resets all registers.  
• When busy is low the module latches A and B (with multiplicand extended to 16 bits) and begins the 8‐cycle multiply.  
• Each clock cycle the module updates accum by conditionally adding the current multiplicand (if multiplier’s LSB is 1), shifts multiplicand left, shifts multiplier right, and increments the counter.  
• On the final (8th) iteration (when count == 7) it writes the result to product and clears busy.

This corrected version is functionally equivalent to the original but is organized in a way that is a bit clearer and follows best practices.
