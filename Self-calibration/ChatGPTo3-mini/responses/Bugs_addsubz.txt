The provided Verilog code is largely correct and synthesizes as intended. However, there are a few enhancements and best practices you might consider:

1. It is best practice to explicitly declare ports (e.g., input wire) to make the intent clear.
2. The combinational always block should assign default values or use a single assignment when possible to avoid any unintentional latches, even though your if-else fully covers all conditions.
3. For clarity and conciseness, you might use a ternary operator for the arithmetic operation and a single-line assignment for zero checking.

Below is the corrected version incorporating these best practices:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  wire       do_sub,
    input  wire [7:0] a,
    input  wire [7:0] b,
    output reg  [7:0] out,
    output reg        result_is_zero
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Perform addition or subtraction based on the control signal
        out = do_sub ? a - b : a + b;
        
        // Check if the result is zero
        result_is_zero = (out == 8'd0);
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Key Changes Made:
• Ports are explicitly declared with the type "wire" for clarity.
• The arithmetic operation utilizes a ternary operator for compactness.
• The zero-check uses a concise assignment.

This version maintains a fully combinational block and follows good design practices.
