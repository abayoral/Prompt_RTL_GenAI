Below is one corrected and slightly “clean‐coded” version of the module. In our revision we made only minor improvements – for example, adding explicit default (initial) assignments inside the combinational always block to avoid inferred latches and removing the unused Q parameter (or you may keep it for documentation of the fixed‐point format). We also added comments and ensured that the arithmetic widths are handled properly. (Functionality remains the same as the original design.) 

Below is the revised code:

--------------------------------------------------
module fixed_point_adder #(parameter Q = 8, parameter N = 16) (
  input  [N-1:0] a,
  input  [N-1:0] b,
  output reg [N-1:0] c
);

  // Compute the magnitudes (absolute values) of a and b.
  // Assumes two’s complement representation.
  wire [N-1:0] abs_a = a[N-1] ? (~a + 1) : a;
  wire [N-1:0] abs_b = b[N-1] ? (~b + 1) : b;

  // Extend the width one extra bit to catch potential overflow.
  wire [N:0] sum = abs_a + abs_b;

  // Internal temporary registers
  reg [N-1:0] res;   // will hold the intermediate result
  reg [N-1:0] diff;  // will hold the difference between magnitudes

  always @(*) begin
    // Initialize signals to avoid unintended latches.
    res = {N{1'b0}};
    diff = {N{1'b0}};
    c = {N{1'b0}};
    
    // Case 1: Operands have the same sign.
    if (a[N-1] == b[N-1]) begin
      // For both positive values:
      if (a[N-1] == 1'b0) begin
        // If the extra (N-th) bit is set then we have an overflow.
        if (sum[N] == 1'b1)
          res = {1'b0, {(N-1){1'b1}}}; // Saturate to maximum positive value.
        else
          res = {1'b0, sum[N-1:0]};
      end
      // For both negative values:
      else begin
        // For negative numbers we sum the magnitudes and then reapply the negative sign.
        if (sum[N] == 1'b1)
          res = {1'b1, {(N-1){1'b0}}}; // Saturate to most negative value.
        else
          res = (~sum[N-1:0] + 1'b1);    // Convert magnitude back to negative.
      end
      c = res;
    end
    // Case 2: The operands have different signs.
    else begin
      // Subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger one.
      if (abs_a >= abs_b) begin
        diff = abs_a - abs_b;
        // The result takes on the sign of a.
        if (a[N-1] == 1'b0)
          res = diff;          // Positive result.
        else 
          res = (~diff + 1'b1);  // Negative result.
      end
      else begin
        diff = abs_b - abs_a;
        // The result takes on the sign of b.
        if (b[N-1] == 1'b0)
          res = diff;          // Positive result.
        else 
          res = (~diff + 1'b1);  // Negative result.
      end
      c = res;
    end
  end

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Key points in the revised version:

1. Initialization: The always block now initializes res, diff, and c at the start so that every branch assigns every signal before they are used, avoiding accidental latch inference.

2. Unused parameter Q: Although Q is not used in any arithmetic here, it is kept in the port list for potential documentation/use in fixed‐point scaling. (If Q is not needed you might remove it.)

3. Saturation: For the same-sign addition the code checks the extra (N-th) bit of the extended result “sum” in order to saturate the result when an overflow occurs.

4. Clarity: Comments have been expanded to explain each operation.

This corrected module adheres to common Verilog coding best practices and should synthesize and simulate as intended.
