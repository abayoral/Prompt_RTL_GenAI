Below is a revised version of the module with a few improvements in style and clarity. In particular, temporary signals used in the combinational process are declared at the top of the always block (which makes the code cleaner and helps ensure synthesizability in Verilog-2001), and comments remain to clarify the intent. (Note: Although SystemVerilog permits declaring “automatic” variables inside a procedural block, many synthesis flows for plain Verilog expect all such variables declared up‐front.) 

Below is one corrected and improved version:

------------------------------------------------------------
module fixed_point_adder #(parameter Q = 8, parameter N = 16)
(
  input  [N-1:0] a,
  input  [N-1:0] b,
  output reg [N-1:0] c
);

  // Determine the sign bits of the operands.
  wire sign_a = a[N-1];
  wire sign_b = b[N-1];

  // Compute the absolute value of each operand.
  // For negative numbers in two's complement, the absolute value is (~value + 1).
  wire [N-1:0] abs_a = sign_a ? (~a + 1) : a;
  wire [N-1:0] abs_b = sign_b ? (~b + 1) : b;

  always @(*) begin
    // Declare temporary variables at the beginning of the block.
    reg [N:0] sum_ext;         // Extended sum for positive additions.
    reg [N-1:0] diff;          // Difference when subtracting magnitudes.
    reg [N-1:0] result;        // Local result to be assigned to output.

    // Case 1: Both operands share the same sign.
    if (sign_a == sign_b) begin
      // Add the absolute values using an extra bit to catch potential overflow.
      sum_ext = abs_a + abs_b;
      
      // Check for overflow: if the MSB of the extended sum is 1,
      // the result exceeds the representable magnitude.
      if (sum_ext[N] == 1'b1) begin
        // Saturation:
        // For positive operands, saturate to maximum positive value.
        // For negative operands, saturate to the most negative value.
        if (sign_a == 1'b0)
          result = {1'b0, {(N-1){1'b1}}};  // Maximum positive value.
        else
          result = {1'b1, {(N-1){1'b0}}};  // Most negative value.
      end
      else begin
        // No overflow; reconstruct the result.
        if (sign_a == 1'b0)
          result = sum_ext[N-1:0];       // Positive: the magnitude directly.
        else
          result = ~sum_ext[N-1:0] + 1;    // Negative: convert magnitude to two’s complement.
      end
    end
    // Case 2: Operands have different signs => perform subtraction.
    else begin
      // Compare the absolute values to decide which operand is larger.
      if (abs_a >= abs_b) begin
        diff = abs_a - abs_b;
        // The result takes the sign of operand 'a'.
        if (sign_a == 1'b1)
          result = ~diff + 1;  // Negative result.
        else
          result = diff;       // Positive result.
      end
      else begin
        diff = abs_b - abs_a;
        // The result takes the sign of operand 'b'.
        if (sign_b == 1'b1)
          result = ~diff + 1;
        else
          result = diff;
      end
    end

    // Assign the computed result to the output.
    c = result;
  end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Key Corrections and Improvements:
1. Temporary variables (sum_ext, diff, result) are declared at the top of the always block so that they’re visible for the entire block, ensuring compatibility with synthesis tools that require all procedural declarations at the beginning.
2. The code now uses a single temporary “result” variable that is then assigned to the output.
3. Comments are provided to clarify each step, preserving the intent while following best practices.

This version should compile and synthesize correctly while preserving the intended fixed‐point addition (with saturation) functionality.
