I reviewed the code thoroughly, and functionally it implements the intended pulse‐detection (detecting a 0→1→0 pattern and outputting a one‐cycle pulse) using a simple state machine. There are no syntax or logical errors that would prevent it from working as specified. 

That said, here are a few minor improvements and clarifications to follow best practices:

1. Although the state encoding with a 2‐bit reg is fine, you can declare the constants in binary (e.g., 2'b00, 2'b01, etc.) which makes it a little clearer.
2. It is a best practice to comment on what each state represents, so that anyone reading the code understands the state machine flow.
3. The default assignments in every branch help ensure that no unintended latches are inferred and that the behavior is clear.
4. The synchronous reset and the nonblocking assignments are used properly.

Below is the “corrected” version with only minor style tweaks and added comments for clarity:

--------------------------------------------------------------
module pulse_detect(
    input        clk,
    input        rst_n,   // Asynchronous active-low reset
    input        data_in,
    output reg   data_out
);

  // State encoding: IDLE = waiting for rising edge,
  // RISE = rising edge detected, waiting for falling edge,
  // FALL = falling edge detected, output pulse.
  localparam IDLE = 2'b00,
             RISE = 2'b01,
             FALL = 2'b10;

  reg [1:0] state;

  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      state    <= IDLE;
      data_out <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      case (state)
        IDLE: begin
          data_out <= 1'b0;
          // Wait for rising edge: if data_in is high, move to RISE state.
          if (data_in)
            state <= RISE;
          else
            state <= IDLE;
        end

        RISE: begin
          data_out <= 1'b0;
          // Stay in RISE state until falling edge is detected.
          if (!data_in)
            state <= FALL;
          else
            state <= RISE;
        end

        FALL: begin
          // On completion of 0→1→0, output a one-cycle pulse.
          data_out <= 1'b1;
          state <= IDLE;
        end

        default: begin
          // Default to known state to avoid latches.
          state    <= IDLE;
          data_out <= 1'b0;
        end
      endcase
    end
  end

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the operation:

• In the IDLE state, data_out remains 0. When data_in becomes high, the state moves to RISE.
• In the RISE state, data_out still remains 0. Once data_in goes low (falling edge), the state transitions to FALL.
• In the FALL state, a pulse (data_out = 1) is generated for one clock cycle, and then the state returns to IDLE.
• A default clause ensures that the state machine resets to a known state.

This version adheres to best practices and is secure and clear. If no additional modifications are required by your environment, this should serve as an excellent and correct implementation.
