Below is one acceptable “fixed” version. Technically, the original code isn’t “wrong” in that it synthesizes and simulates as a mod‐10 counter (counting 1 through 10), but there are a couple of points worth noting:

1. Synchronous versus Asynchronous Reset:  
  • In your original code the reset is handled synchronously (only checked on posedge clk). Many designers prefer an asynchronous reset (checked immediately when asserted) for better control of initialization.  
  • If you want an asynchronous reset, the reset signal should be included in the always block’s sensitivity list.

2. Best Practices:  
  • It’s also a good practice to use parameters or localparams for constants. This makes your design easier to modify and more self‐documenting.

Below are two versions—a synchronous reset version (very similar to your original code) and an asynchronous reset version.

Synchronous Reset Version (Original Behavior):

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 4'd1;
        else if (q == 4'd10)
            q <= 4'd1;
        else
            q <= q + 4'd1;
    end

endmodule

Asynchronous Reset Version (Recommended Improvement):

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Use localparams to define counter limits
    localparam MIN = 4'd1;
    localparam MAX = 4'd10;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= MIN;
        else if (q == MAX)
            q <= MIN;
        else
            q <= q + 4'd1;
    end

endmodule

Either version implements a counter that counts from 1 to 10 and then wraps to 1. Choose the one that best fits your design requirements regarding reset behavior.
