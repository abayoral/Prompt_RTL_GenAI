Below is one improved version of the code. Although your original code is functionally correct as a synchronous counter (it counts 1, 2, …, 10 then wraps back to 1), it can be improved by:

• Using the full sensitivity list (adding an asynchronous reset if that is desired), and
• Including begin…end blocks to make the code clearer and more robust.

For example, if you want an asynchronous, active‐high reset, you might write:

-----------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'd1;
    end else if (q == 4'd10) begin
        q <= 4'd1;
    end else begin
        q <= q + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------

Notes:
1. In this version, reset is asynchronous (included in the sensitivity list). If you only intend for a synchronous reset, then you can leave reset out of the sensitivity list as in your original design.
2. The counter resets to 1 on both a reset and when the counter reaches 10. This gives a sequence 1, 2, …, 10, 1, … If you intended a different behavior (for example starting at 0 or counting 0–9), adjust the values accordingly.

This version adheres to best practices by clearly showing the control flows and the proper sensitivity list.
