I reviewed the provided Verilog module, and it implements the combinational logic correctly. There are no logical, syntax, or functional errors in the code. All assignments use the proper operators, and the module is synthesizable as written.

That said, here is the same module with some minor modifications to follow best practices (such as explicitly declaring signals as wires, even though they are the default, to improve readability):

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    output wire out_and,
    output wire out_or,
    output wire out_xor,
    output wire out_nand,
    output wire out_nor,
    output wire out_xnor,
    output wire out_anotb
);

    // Combinational logic assignments
    assign out_and   = a & b;
    assign out_or    = a | b;
    assign out_xor   = a ^ b;
    assign out_nand  = ~(a & b);
    assign out_nor   = ~(a | b);
    assign out_xnor  = ~(a ^ b);
    assign out_anotb = a & (~b);
    
endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

No functional errors were found; this version simply adds explicit wire declarations for clarity.
