The Verilog code you provided is functionally correct and synthesizes as expected. The module properly takes a, b, and sel as inputs and uses the conditional operator to select between a and b for the output.

For best practices, you might consider the following small improvements:

1. Adding a timescale directive at the top if this module is going to be simulated.
2. Using an explicit "default_nettype none" to help catch any accidental undeclared nets.
3. Including comments to document the functionality (this is optional but often useful for maintainability).

Here is the improved version incorporating these suggestions:

------------------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
`default_nettype none

module top_module( 
    input  [99:0] a, 
    input  [99:0] b,
    input         sel,
    output [99:0] out 
);
    // Use the conditional operator to choose between inputs
    assign out = sel ? b : a;
endmodule

`default_nettype wire
------------------------------------------------------------

Note:
• The `default_nettype wire directive at the end resets the default net type for any following modules. 
• The timescale directive is useful during simulation to define the time unit and precision.

This version adheres to best practices without altering the original functionality.
