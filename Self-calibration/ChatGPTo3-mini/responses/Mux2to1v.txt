The provided module is functionally correct, and there are no logical or syntax errors in the code. It takes two 100-bit inputs (a and b), a select line (sel), and outputs one of the two inputs based on the value of sel using a continuous assignment with the ternary operator.

As a best practice, you might consider the following minor improvements:

1. Adding a timescale directive at the top (if used for simulation).
2. Formatting the port declarations with one port per line for improved readability.

Below is an updated version of the module with these enhancements:

--------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module top_module(
    input  [99:0] a,
    input  [99:0] b,
    input         sel,
    output [99:0] out
);
    // When 'sel' is high, output 'b', otherwise output 'a'
    assign out = sel ? b : a;
    
endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

This version adheres to best coding practices while preserving the original functionality.
