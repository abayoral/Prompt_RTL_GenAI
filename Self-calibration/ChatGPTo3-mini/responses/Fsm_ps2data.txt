Below is one corrected version. Note that the originally generated module was functionally correct. However, to adhere to best practices (for example, giving default assignments in the combinational logic and renaming a port to avoid the generic name “in”), one acceptable corrected version is shown below:

---------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input       clk,
    input       reset,       // active high, synchronous reset
    input [7:0] in_byte,     // renamed to in_byte for clarity
    output reg [23:0] out_bytes,
    output reg  done
);

    // FSM state encoding
    localparam WAIT  = 2'd0,  // Waiting for header (byte with bit[3]==1)
               BYTE1 = 2'd1,  // Header received – collecting second byte
               BYTE2 = 2'd2;  // Second byte received – collecting third byte

    reg [1:0] state, next_state;

    // Sequential block: update state and capture bytes.
    // Using synchronous reset.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state     <= WAIT;
            out_bytes <= 24'd0;
            done      <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
            // Set default for done (unless we complete the packet)
            done <= 1'b0;
            
            case (state)
                WAIT: begin
                    // When header detected, capture the first byte (upper 8 bits).
                    if (in_byte[3])
                        out_bytes[23:16] <= in_byte;
                end
                BYTE1: begin
                    // Capture second byte.
                    out_bytes[15:8] <= in_byte;
                end
                BYTE2: begin
                    // Capture third byte, complete the 24-bit message.
                    out_bytes[7:0] <= in_byte;
                    done <= 1'b1; // Assert done when packet is complete.
                end
                default: ;
            endcase
        end
    end

    // Combinational block: next-state logic.
    always @(*) begin
        // Default next state assignment (best practice)
        next_state = state;
        case (state)
            WAIT: begin
                if (in_byte[3])
                    next_state = BYTE1;  // Header detected; move to collecting second byte.
                else
                    next_state = WAIT;
            end
            BYTE1: begin
                next_state = BYTE2;      // Move to collecting the third byte.
            end
            BYTE2: begin
                next_state = WAIT;       // After completion, return to waiting for header.
            end
            default: next_state = WAIT;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
---------------------------------------------------

Key improvements compared to the original:

1. Renamed the 8‑bit input from “in” to “in_byte” to avoid using a generic name.
2. In the combinational always block (for next_state), a default assignment (“next_state = state”) is provided before the case statement.
3. The comments were enhanced to clarify that the reset is synchronous and to explain the FSM behavior.

This version adheres to best practices while preserving the original intended functionality.
