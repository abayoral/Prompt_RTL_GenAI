The module you provided is already correct with no syntax or logical errors. It properly assigns a constant logic high (1) to the output "one". 

However, to adhere to common best practices and make the intent explicit, you might consider the following minor improvements:
• Explicitly declare the output as a wire (although it defaults to wire).
• Ensure proper commenting to assist in readability.

Below is the "corrected" version that follows these practices:

---------------------------------
module top_module(
    output wire one   // Declare the output explicitly as a wire.
);

    // Always drive the output 'one' with logic high (1).
    assign one = 1'b1;

endmodule
---------------------------------

This version functions identically to your original code while following best practices in port declaration.
