After reviewing the module, I found no logical, syntax, or functional errors. The code correctly:

• Defines a 3-bit input vector (vec).
• Assigns the entire input vector to the 3-bit output vector (outv).
• Splits the input vector into three single-bit outputs (o2, o1, o0) in the expected order.

For clarity and adherence to best practices, here is the same module with a few stylistic improvements (such as consistent formatting and comments), although functionally it remains unchanged:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  wire [2:0] vec,
    output wire [2:0] outv,
    output wire       o2,
    output wire       o1,
    output wire       o0
);

    // Pass the input vector directly to the output vector
    assign outv = vec;
    
    // Split the input vector into three separate 1-bit outputs
    assign o0 = vec[0];
    assign o1 = vec[1];
    assign o2 = vec[2];

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

This version is functionally equivalent to your original code and does not change any behavior. The original code was already correct.
