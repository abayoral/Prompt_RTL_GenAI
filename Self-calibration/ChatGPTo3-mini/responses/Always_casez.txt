After reviewing the code, I found that it is functionally and syntactically correct. The module implements a simple combinational priority encoder that assigns the output pos based on the first high bit in the input (starting from in[0]). All branches have an assignment, so there is no risk of inferred latches, and the use of an always @(*) block with blocking assignments is acceptable for combinational logic.

That said, here are a few suggestions for best practices and style improvements:

1. Although your chain of if/else statements works fine, sometimes designers prefer using a case statement (or even a loop in SystemVerilog) for clarity. For a small number of conditions, the if/else chain is acceptable.

2. Ensure that the priority you intended (from in[0] upward) is what you want. In your code, if multiple bits are high, the lowest index bit takes priority.

3. You might want to initialize pos at the beginning of the always block for clarity (even though every branch already assigns a value).

Below is a revised version that incorporates these suggestions without changing the intended functionality:

----------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  [7:0] in,
    output reg [2:0] pos
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignment: if none of the bits are high, pos will be 0.
        pos = 3'd0;  
        if (in[0])
            pos = 3'd0;
        else if (in[1])
            pos = 3'd1;
        else if (in[2])
            pos = 3'd2;
        else if (in[3])
            pos = 3'd3;
        else if (in[4])
            pos = 3'd4;
        else if (in[5])
            pos = 3'd5;
        else if (in[6])
            pos = 3'd6;
        else if (in[7])
            pos = 3'd7;
    end

endmodule
----------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, if you prefer a case statement for clarity, you can write the module as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  [7:0] in,
    output reg [2:0] pos
);

    always @(*) begin
        casez (in)
            8'bxxxxxxx1: pos = 3'd0;
            8'bxxxxxx10: pos = 3'd1;
            8'bxxxxx100: pos = 3'd2;
            8'bxxxx1000: pos = 3'd3;
            8'bxxx10000: pos = 3'd4;
            8'bxx100000: pos = 3'd5;
            8'bx1000000: pos = 3'd6;
            8'b10000000: pos = 3'd7;
            default:     pos = 3'd0;  // All bits are 0
        endcase
    end

endmodule
----------------------------------------------------------

Both versions adhere to best practices, and the functionality remains unchanged. No corrections were necessary for the original code in terms of logical, syntax, or functional errors.
