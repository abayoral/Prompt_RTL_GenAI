Below is a corrected (and slightly refined) version of your module. In your original code there were no real syntax or logical errors; it functioned as intended. The changes below are only minor cleanup improvements for clarity and style:

• Renamed the reset condition to show it is active low.
• Simplified the default branch in the fetch select because the registers naturally retain their values if not updated.
• Added more detailed comments to make the code easier to understand.

Note that functionally your original design was correct.

-----------------------------------------------------------
module instr_reg (
    input         clk,       // Clock signal for synchronization
    input         rst_n,     // Active low reset signal (renamed to clarify active low)
    input   [1:0] fetch,     // 2-bit control signal for selecting instruction source
    input   [7:0] data,      // 8-bit data input representing the instruction
    output  [2:0] ins,       // High 3 bits (opcode) from the instruction in ins_p1
    output  [4:0] ad1,       // Low 5 bits (register address) from the instruction in ins_p1
    output  [7:0] ad2        // Complete 8-bit instruction from ins_p2 (from second source)
);

  // Internal 8-bit registers to hold instructions from different sources
  reg [7:0] ins_p1, ins_p2;

  // Process block triggered on the rising edge of clk or the falling edge of rst_n.
  // When rst_n is low, both registers are asynchronously reset to zero.
  // Otherwise, based on the fetch control signal, the corresponding instruction register is updated.
  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      ins_p1 <= 8'd0;
      ins_p2 <= 8'd0;
    end else begin
      case (fetch)
        2'b01: ins_p1 <= data;  // When fetch equals 01, update the first instruction register.
        2'b10: ins_p2 <= data;  // When fetch equals 10, update the second instruction register.
        default: begin
          // When fetch is not 01 or 10, do not update any instructions (retain current values).
          // This branch is optional because registers will hold their value if not reassigned.
          ins_p1 <= ins_p1;
          ins_p2 <= ins_p2;
        end
      endcase
    end
  end

  // Output assignments:
  //   ins[2:0] is the upper 3 bits (opcode) from ins_p1.
  //   ad1[4:0] is the lower 5 bits (address) from ins_p1.
  //   ad2[7:0] is the complete 8-bit instruction from ins_p2.
  assign ins = ins_p1[7:5];
  assign ad1 = ins_p1[4:0];
  assign ad2 = ins_p2;

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Changes:
1. The reset signal has been renamed from rst to rst_n to clearly indicate that it is active low.
2. The default branch in the case statement is maintained for clarity, although it is not strictly necessary because registers naturally retain their values unless updated.
3. Comments have been expanded for clarity and to adhere to best practices in documentation.

This version adheres to best practices and does not have any logical, syntax, or functional errors.
