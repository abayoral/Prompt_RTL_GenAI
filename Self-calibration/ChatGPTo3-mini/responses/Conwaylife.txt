Below is one acceptable corrected version. In our “fix” we have parameterized the grid size, replaced “magic numbers” (like 15) with expressions based on the parameter, and declared the neighbor counter with an appropriate bit‐width. (Note that the original code was functionally correct, so the changes are mainly style and best‐practice improvements.)

--------------------------------------------------

Notes on the changes made:
1. Parameterization: Using a parameter (DIM) to define grid size makes the design more maintainable.
2. Count: Declared as a 4‐bit register instead of an integer, since the neighbor count never exceeds 8.
3. Readability: Clear comments and consistent formatting improve readability.

This version adheres to best practices and, assuming the synthesis tool supports these constructs, is a secure and maintainable implementation of Conway’s Game of Life on a 16×16 toroidal grid.
