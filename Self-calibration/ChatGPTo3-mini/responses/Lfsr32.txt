Below is an annotated version of the module. After a careful review, the original code “works” as intended—there are no syntax, functional, or logical errors. However, a few minor improvements can help readability and maintainability. For example, it is sometimes preferable not to use “next” as a variable name (since some coding styles reserve that name) and to use a name such as next_state. The improved version below also adds a parameter for the reset value, which is a common best practice.

module top_module(
    input         clk,
    input         reset,     // active‐high synchronous reset (resets to STATE_INIT)
    output reg [31:0] q
);

    // Parameter for the reset state
    parameter STATE_INIT = 32'h1;

    // Intermediate register holding the next state.
    reg [31:0] next_state;

    always @(*) begin
        // Default: shift left one bit (dropping the MSB and adding a 0 at LSB)
        next_state = {q[30:0], 1'b0};

        // f is the feedback taken from the MSB (q[31])
        // Inject tapped feedback according to the polynomial:
        //   x^32 + x^22 + x^2 + x + 1
        //
        // The taps (other than the feedback tap at x^32) are:
        //   x^22 (affects next_state[22] using q[21]),
        //   x^2  (affects next_state[1]  using q[0]), and
        //   x^1  (affects next_state[0]  using q[31]).
        //
        // Note: q[31] is the MSB (corresponding to x^32), while q[0] is the LSB (x^1).
        next_state[22] = q[21] ^ q[31]; // tap for x^22
        next_state[1]  = q[0]  ^ q[31]; // tap for x^2
        next_state[0]  = q[31];         // tap for x^1
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= STATE_INIT;     // Synchronous reset sets the state to STATE_INIT
        else
            q <= next_state;     // Otherwise, update state with calculated next_state
    end

endmodule

Explanation of the improvements:
1. Renamed the combinational signal from next to next_state so as not to risk confusion with any reserved language keywords.
2. Added a parameter (STATE_INIT) for the reset value. This encapsulates the reset constant, facilitating future changes.
3. Kept the original feedback tap injection and shift logic as described in the comments.

This version adheres to best practices and meets the original specifications without introducing any changes in functionality.
