Below is a revised version of the module with some improvements and annotations. In the original module the logic is essentially correct, but the following enhancements have been made:

1. Added an asynchronous active‐low reset (rst_n) so that the counter and output are initialized to known values. This is a best practice for synchronous designs.
2. Added comments to document the functionality.
3. Included a note regarding the “freq” input: if there is any chance it could be zero, you may want to add extra logic to avoid a subtraction underflow (since (freq – 1) is used).

If you are sure that freq will always be nonzero, you can leave the comparison as is.

Below is the corrected version:

------------------------------------------------
module square_wave(
    input  wire       clk,
    input  wire       rst_n,    // Active-low reset
    input  wire [7:0] freq,     // Frequency divider value; must be nonzero
    output reg        wave_out  // Output square wave
);

  // 8-bit counter to generate the square wave period
  reg [7:0] count;

  // On reset, initialize the counter and output.
  // On each rising edge of the clock, the module increments the counter.
  // When the counter reaches (freq-1), it resets to 0 and toggles wave_out.
  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      count   <= 8'd0;
      wave_out <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      // If freq is 0, the subtraction will underflow; ensure freq is nonzero.
      if (count == (freq - 1)) begin
        count <= 8'd0;        // Reset counter
        wave_out <= ~wave_out;  // Toggle output
      end else begin
        count <= count + 8'd1; // Increment counter
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

Notes:
• The reset (rst_n) ensures proper initialization. If your design does not require a reset signal, you may remove the reset logic and provide initialization via synthesis constraints or other methods.
• If there is any possibility that freq might be zero, consider adding an extra conditional check to avoid potential underflow.

This version adheres to common best practices for Verilog coding in a verification/synthesis environment.
