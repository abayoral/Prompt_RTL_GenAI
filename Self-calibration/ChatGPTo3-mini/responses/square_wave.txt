Below is one corrected version of the module that addresses two issues:

1. Registers are given a safe initial condition via a reset (best practice for synthesis and simulation).
2. The case when freq is zero is handled (because subtracting 1 from 0 gives 8'hFF, which is almost certainly not what is desired).

If you are sure that freq will always be nonzero and you have another part of your design that resets your registers, then your original code “works.” However, it is generally good practice to include a reset and defend against edge cases. One acceptable corrected version is:

------------------------------------------------------------
module square_wave(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,         // active-high reset
    input wire [7:0] freq,
    output reg wave_out
);

  reg [7:0] count;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
      count    <= 8'd0;
      wave_out <= 1'b0;
    end
    else begin
      // If the frequency is 0, hold the output; avoids subtract-underflow issues.
      if (freq == 8'd0) begin
        count    <= 8'd0;
        wave_out <= wave_out;
      end
      else if (count == (freq - 1)) begin
        count    <= 8'd0;
        wave_out <= ~wave_out;
      end
      else begin
        count <= count + 1;
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Changes:
• A synchronous reset (rst) is added to initialize count and wave_out.
• An extra branch checks if freq is 0. In that case, the counter is held at 0 and wave_out remains constant. (You might instead want to define a particular behavior for freq=0.)
• The rest of the logic remains the same; when count reaches (freq-1) (i.e. after freq clock cycles), count resets to 0 and wave_out toggles.

This corrected version adheres to best practices by initializing registers and avoiding arithmetic issues with an input of zero.
