Below is one acceptable corrected version. In our “fix” we did not change the overall structure or function of the design (since its operation is as intended) but we did clean up a few details and added default assignments so that every signal is explicitly set in every branch. In addition, we “complete” the parity module’s clocked process (so that synthesis tools see an explicit latch‐free design). (There are several acceptable ways to write the code.)

Explanation of the Improvements:
1. Default assignments for done and parity_reset_signal are made at the beginning of the always block so that every branch of the case statement is well defined.
2. In the parity module, an else clause was added so that synthesis tools clearly infer a clocked register without latches.
3. The code comments were clarified to indicate that reset is synchronous and that the parity_reset_signal is used to clear the parity counter one clock cycle.

This version should function identically to the original but follows best practices for clarity and synthesis robustness.
