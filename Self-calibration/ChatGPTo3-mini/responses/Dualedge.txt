Below is a corrected (and slightly improved) version of the module. In the original code there were no “syntax” errors in a simulation sense, but there are a few issues worth addressing:

1. Using clk directly as the mux select in a continuous assignment can be problematic. Although the intent is to build a “double‐edge‐triggered flip–flop” by combining a posedge and a negedge process, using the clock signal in a combinational mux can lead to glitches and is generally bad practice. It is better to “isolate” clock signals from combinational logic (or, if you do use them, to at least document the intent).

2. Many FPGA flows do not support or recommend negative–edge triggered registers. (If targeting FPGA, consider using a dedicated DDR register or adjusting your design.) For simulation and ASIC flows the code may work as written, but it is still best practice to avoid unexpected behavior by not mixing asynchronous logic with a clock net.

3. Although q was driven by a continuous assign, in a design like this it can be preferable to use a combinational always block to clearly capture the intended logic.

In the corrected version below we:
• Continue to capture d on both the positive and negative edges into separate registers.
• Use an always_comb (or always @(*) in Verilog) block to drive q. 
• Add comments noting the potential design issues when using both clock edges and using clk as a mux select signal.

Here’s the corrected version:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  clk,
    input  d,
    output reg q  // declare q as reg since it is driven in an always block
);

    // Internal registers to capture d on posedge and negedge of clk
    reg pos_ff, neg_ff;
    
    // Positive edge triggered flip-flop capturing d
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        pos_ff <= d;
    end
    
    // Negative edge triggered flip-flop capturing d
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        neg_ff <= d;
    end
    
    // Combinational multiplexer:
    // When clk is high, use the posedge FF value.
    // When clk is low, use the negedge FF value.
    // NOTE: Using the clock (clk) as a multiplexer select signal is not best practice
    // because it is derived from the global clock. Review this design decision for your target technology.
    always @(*) begin
        if (clk)
            q = pos_ff;
        else
            q = neg_ff;
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Notes:
• If your target technology does not support negative edge triggered logic (common in FPGAs), consider using a different approach (for example, using a DDR flip–flop or sampling d twice on the same clock edge and then interpolating the value).
• This corrected code now clearly separates synchronous (flip–flop) and combinational (mux) logic, and it documents the potential design caveats.
