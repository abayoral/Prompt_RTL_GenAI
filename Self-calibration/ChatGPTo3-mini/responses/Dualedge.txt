Below is one corrected and improved version of the module. In your original code the functionality was essentially correct—but combining clock‐sampling flip–flops (one on posedge, one on negedge) with a multiplexer driven directly by the clock may lead to glitches (and might not map directly to FPGA DDR resources without special care). It’s generally best practice to avoid using the clock signal as a combinational mux selector because of potential timing hazards.

The revised version below makes the following changes:
1. It declares all ports with an explicit type (wire/input/output).
2. It wraps the combinational multiplexer in an always @(*) block (using an intermediate q_reg) for clarity.
3. It adds comments to explain that this style is one way to achieve a double-data rate (DDR) like effect but that in real FPGA designs you might need to use dedicated DDR primitives for reliable operation.

module top_module (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire d,
    output wire q
);

    // Two registers: one sampling d at the rising edge and one sampling d at the falling edge.
    reg pos_reg;
    reg neg_reg;
    
    // Positive-edge triggered flip-flop: samples d at rising edge.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        pos_reg <= d;
    end

    // Negative-edge triggered flip-flop: samples d at falling edge.
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        neg_reg <= d;
    end

    // Combinational logic to select between the two registers.
    // Note: using clk as the mux select can lead to glitches. In many designs,
    // a registered output or dedicated DDR output primitives are preferred.
    reg q_reg;
    always @(*) begin
        if (clk)
            q_reg = pos_reg;
        else
            q_reg = neg_reg;
    end

    assign q = q_reg;

endmodule
----------------------------------------------------------------

A few notes:

• Although the original code’s assignment “assign q = clk ? pos_reg : neg_reg;” is functionally similar, wrapping the combinational logic inside an always @(*) block (with an intermediate register like q_reg) may make the designer’s intent clearer—and helps avoid synthesis warnings in some tools.

• Using clock as a mux select is generally discouraged because it can create glitches and timing issues in the combinational path; if your intent is to create a DDR output, review your target synthesis tool’s guidelines (or use dedicated DDR output primitives) to ensure reliable operation.

This corrected version adheres to best practices while keeping the functionality you described.
