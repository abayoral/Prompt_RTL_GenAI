Below is one corrected and slightly refactored version of the dual‐port RAM that fixes minor issues and adheres to best practices. In our “corrected” version we:

• • Explain that using $clog2 is a SystemVerilog feature. (If you must support pre–SystemVerilog flows, you might replace it with your own clog2 function.)
• • Use clear if–else constructs so that reset and normal operations are unambiguous.
• • Use nonblocking assignments (≤) exclusively in sequential always blocks.
• • Add a comment regarding the synchronous initialization of an array (some tools infer block RAM but others may require an external initialization file or different reset style).

Below is one acceptable solution:

------------------------------------------------------------
module dual_port_ram #
  (parameter WIDTH = 6,
   parameter DEPTH = 8,
   // if DEPTH might be 1 or less, force ADDR_WIDTH to be at least 1.
   parameter ADDR_WIDTH = (DEPTH > 1) ? $clog2(DEPTH) : 1)
(
   input                    clk,
   input                    rst_n,
   input                    write_en,
   input  [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]  write_addr,
   input  [WIDTH-1:0]       write_data,
   input                    read_en,
   input  [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]  read_addr,
   output reg [WIDTH-1:0]   read_data
);

   // Memory array declaration
   reg [WIDTH-1:0] mem [0:DEPTH-1];
   integer i;

   // Write Process: Synchronous reset and write operation.
   // Note: Initializing an entire memory array on reset is synthesizable in some
   // tools for block RAM; in others you might prefer to use an initialization file.
   always @(posedge clk) begin
      if (!rst_n) begin
         // Reset: initialize all locations in mem to zero.
         for (i = 0; i < DEPTH; i = i + 1)
            mem[i] <= {WIDTH{1'b0}};
      end
      else begin
         if (write_en)
            mem[write_addr] <= write_data;
      end
   end

   // Read Process: Synchronous reset and synchronous read.
   always @(posedge clk) begin
      if (!rst_n) begin
         read_data <= {WIDTH{1'b0}};
      end
      else begin
         if (read_en)
            read_data <= mem[read_addr];
         // Optionally, else clause can be added to define behavior when read_en is 0.
      end
   end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of changes and considerations:

1. The use of $clog2  
   • $clog2 is a SystemVerilog feature. If you are using a tool or standard that does not support it, you may need to write your own clog2 function.

2. Synchronous reset  
   • Both always blocks use a synchronous reset. Some designers prefer an asynchronous reset (i.e. “always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n)”) but this depends on your design style and the target FPGAs or ASIC library. We used synchronous reset here as was in the original code.

3. Memory Initialization  
   • Not all synthesis tools will infer a block RAM with a reset loop. Some might require an external initialization file. Adjust according to your target!

4. Code style  
   • We have made sure that the if–else conditions are clear. The nonblocking assignment (<=) is used throughout to avoid unintended latching or race problems.

Feel free to adjust the reset style (synchronous versus asynchronous) and the memory initialization based on your synthesis and design needs.
