The provided Verilog module is actually correct in terms of syntax and functionality. It properly implements an asynchronous reset (active‐high) that resets q to zero, a synchronous load that loads data into q, and an enable-controlled right-shift. The use of nonblocking assignments and the ordering of conditions inside the always block follow best practices.

That said, here’s a slightly reformatted version of your code with some minor comments for clarity:

--------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns / 1ps  // Optional: specify timescale for simulation

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input areset,  // asynchronous active-high reset to zero
    input load,
    input ena,
    input [3:0] data,
    output reg [3:0] q
);
    
    // Always block with asynchronous reset.
    // If reset is asserted, q resets to 0.
    // On the rising edge of clk, if load is high, q loads data.
    // Otherwise, if ena is high, q is shifted right by 1 with 0 shifted in.
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset)
            q <= 4'b0000;
        else if (load)
            q <= data;
        else if (ena)
            q <= {1'b0, q[3:1]};
    end

endmodule
