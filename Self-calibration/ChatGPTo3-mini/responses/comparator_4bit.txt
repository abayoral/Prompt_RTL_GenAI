Below is an improved version of the module. Although the original code was mostly correct, one potential point of confusion is that the two 5‐bit concatenations ({1’b0, A} and {1’b0, B}) are unsigned. Even though their MSB is always 0, it’s best practice to explicitly cast them to signed values to ensure that the subtraction operates as intended in all synthesis and simulation environments. In addition, the formatting and comments have been slightly refined for clarity.

Here’s the corrected version:

-----------------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module comparator_4bit(
    input  [3:0] A,
    input  [3:0] B,
    output A_greater,
    output A_equal,
    output A_less
);

    // Extend the inputs to 5 bits and cast them as signed so that we correctly capture
    // the sign (borrow) from the subtraction. This ensures that the result of the subtraction
    // is interpreted in two’s complement form.
    wire signed [4:0] diff;
    assign diff = $signed({1'b0, A}) - $signed({1'b0, B});

    // Determine the outputs:
    // If diff is zero, then A and B are equal.
    assign A_equal   = (diff == 0);
    // If A and B are not equal and diff is negative (sign bit = 1), then A < B.
    assign A_less    = (~A_equal) & diff[4];
    // If A and B are not equal and diff is positive (sign bit = 0), then A > B.
    assign A_greater = (~A_equal) & (~diff[4]);

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------

Key improvements and best practices applied:

1. Explicit signed casting using $signed ensures that the subtraction between {1’b0, A} and {1’b0, B} is carried out in two’s complement arithmetic.

2. Removing the literal “5’d0” in favor of “0” when checking for equality is acceptable because the numerical literal is correctly interpreted with the appropriate width.

3. Added a timescale directive for simulation clarity.

This version should work reliably in simulations and synthesis while remaining clear and maintainable.
