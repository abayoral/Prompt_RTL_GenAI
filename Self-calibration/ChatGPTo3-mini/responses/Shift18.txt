Below is one acceptable corrected version. The original code was largely correct but can be improved by:

1. Declaring signals with an explicit type (using “wire” for inputs and making clear what is expected).
2. If you intend to perform an arithmetic right shift on a signed number, then it’s best to declare q as signed and to use the Verilog arithmetic shift operator (>>>). (Note that if you wish to maintain the bit‐replication style, that is also acceptable.)
3. Adding a default branch for completeness is optional since all possible 2‐bit values are covered.

Below are two corrected and improved versions.

──────────────────────────────
Version 1: Using explicit replication of the sign bit (unchanged functionality)

module top_module(
    input  wire       clk,
    input  wire       load,
    input  wire       ena,
    input  wire [1:0] amount,
    input  wire [63:0] data,
    output reg  [63:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            case(amount)
                2'b00: q <= q << 1; // Shift left by 1
                2'b01: q <= q << 8; // Shift left by 8
                2'b10: q <= {q[63], q[63:1]}; // Arithmetic right shift by 1 (replicate MSB)
                2'b11: q <= { {8{q[63]}}, q[63:8] }; // Arithmetic right shift by 8 (replicate MSB into top 8 bits)
                default: q <= q;
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule

──────────────────────────────
Version 2: Using the arithmetic shift operator (recommended if q is to be treated as signed)

module top_module(
    input  wire       clk,
    input  wire       load,
    input  wire       ena,
    input  wire [1:0] amount,
    input  wire [63:0] data,
    output reg  signed [63:0] q  // declared as signed
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            case(amount)
                2'b00: q <= q << 1;   // Shift left by 1
                2'b01: q <= q << 8;   // Shift left by 8
                2'b10: q <= q >>> 1;  // Arithmetic right shift by 1
                2'b11: q <= q >>> 8;  // Arithmetic right shift by 8
                default: q <= q;
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule

Both versions are functionally equivalent. Version 2 may be preferred because:
• It clearly indicates (via the "signed" declaration and ">>>" operator) that an arithmetic shift is intended.
• It is more concise and easier to maintain.

Choose the version that best matches your design intent.
