Below is the revised module. The original code was mostly correct, but note that the arithmetic right‐shift operators (>>>) require that the operands be signed. In your original code, q (and data) were declared as 64‑bit vectors without the signed qualifier, so the arithmetic shifts might not behave as intended. In the corrected module, q and data are now declared as signed. This change ensures that the arithmetic shift operations (>>>) sign‐extend as expected. Additionally, a default branch in the case statement is redundant for a 2‑bit selector but is kept for clarity.

------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input  clk,
    input  load,
    input  ena,
    input  [1:0] amount,
    input  signed [63:0] data,
    output reg signed [63:0] q
);
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            case (amount)
                2'b00: q <= q << 1;    // Logical shift left by 1 bit
                2'b01: q <= q << 8;    // Logical shift left by 8 bits
                2'b10: q <= q >>> 1;   // Arithmetic shift right by 1 bit
                2'b11: q <= q >>> 8;   // Arithmetic shift right by 8 bits
                default: q <= q;       // (Redundant) default branch
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

Key corrections and improvements:

1. Declared both data and q as signed so that the arithmetic right-shift (>>>) performs sign extension.
2. Maintained comments for clarity regarding the intended shift operations.
3. Preserved the overall structure and functionality while ensuring that the operations behave as intended.

This version should now meet best practices and perform correctly for both logical and arithmetic shift operations.
