Below is one corrected version. In fact, the original code is functionally correct, but the overflow‐detection logic can be written in a more conventional and compact way using the well‐known two’s complement overflow condition for subtraction. One common way to detect overflow for A – B is to note that overflow occurs when the sign of A and B differ and the sign of the result differs from A. That is, using the condition

  overflow = (A[63] ^ B[63]) & (A[63] ^ result[63]);

Below is the revised module using that approach (with a few minor stylistic improvements):

------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module sub_64bit(
    input  signed [63:0] A,
    input  signed [63:0] B,
    output signed [63:0] result,
    output              overflow
);

  // Perform subtraction
  assign result = A - B;

  // Overflow detection: For two's complement subtraction A - B, overflow 
  // occurs if A and B have different signs and the sign of result is different from A.
  assign overflow = (A[63] ^ B[63]) & (A[63] ^ result[63]);

endmodule`
------------------------------------------------

Explanations:

1. The original overflow logic was correct if read carefully:
  - When A is positive (A[63]=0) and B is negative (B[63]=1), overflow occurs if result[63] becomes 1.
  - When A is negative (A[63]=1) and B is positive (B[63]=0), overflow occurs if result[63] becomes 0.
  This is equivalent to checking that A[63] ≠ B[63] and result[63] ≠ A[63].

2. The rewritten overflow expression is more standard and easier to understand.

3. A timescale directive was added (it’s optional) for simulation purposes.

This version adheres to best practices and security (no unintended latches, proper use of combinational assignment, clear overflow detection), making the design both clear and robust.
