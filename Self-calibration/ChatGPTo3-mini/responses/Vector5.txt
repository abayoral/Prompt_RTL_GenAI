Below is a corrected, improved version of the module. The major issue was with the replication‐expression for the second vector. In Verilog the replication operator must be applied to an expression by enclosing that expression in braces, so the vector {a,b,c,d,e} must be written as {a, b, c, d, e} and then replicated using the syntax {5{ … }}. (Also, although using ~( … ^ …) correctly implements bitwise XNOR, we can also use the built‐in bitwise XNOR operator ~^.) 

Below are two versions: one keeping your original style and one using ~^ for clarity. Both have been refactored for clarity and best practices.

──────────────────────────────
Version 1 – Using ~( … ^ …):

module top_module (
    input  a, b, c, d, e,
    output [24:0] out
);

    // Construct a 25‐bit vector where each block is a 5‐bit 
    // repunit vector of one input.
    // The first vector: blocks = { {5{a}}, {5{b}}, {5{c}}, {5{d}}, {5{e}} }
    wire [24:0] vector1 = { {5{a}}, {5{b}}, {5{c}}, {5{d}}, {5{e}} };

    // The second vector is the 5‐bit vector {a,b,c,d,e} repeated 5 times.
    // The inner vector must be enclosed in braces and then replicated.
    wire [24:0] vector2 = {5{ {a, b, c, d, e} }};

    // Compute the bitwise XNOR by taking the negation of the XOR.
    assign out = ~( vector1 ^ vector2 );
    
endmodule

──────────────────────────────
Version 2 – Using the bitwise XNOR operator (~^):

module top_module (
    input  a, b, c, d, e,
    output [24:0] out
);

    // Construct the two 25‐bit vectors as before.
    wire [24:0] vector1 = { {5{a}}, {5{b}}, {5{c}}, {5{d}}, {5{e}} };
    wire [24:0] vector2 = {5{ {a, b, c, d, e} }};

    // Use the built‐in bitwise XNOR operator.
    assign out = vector1 ~^ vector2;
    
endmodule

Notes:

1. The expression {5{ {a, b, c, d, e} }} replicates the 5‐bit vector {a,b,c,d,e} five times to form a 25‐bit vector.
2. Both versions achieve the same functionality; choose the style that best fits your design guidelines.

This corrected module now complies with Verilog syntax and best practices while faithfully implementing the intended functionality.
