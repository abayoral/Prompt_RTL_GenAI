Below is one corrected version of the module. In the original code the designer computed bitwise XNOR by taking the bitwise complement of the “row” vector and then XORing it with the “column” vector. Although this produces correct results for one‐bit signals, it is clearer and more conventional to use the Verilog bitwise XNOR operator (^~). In addition, it is good practice to create intermediate wires for the two 25‐bit vectors. The corrected module is shown below:

-----------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  a, b, c, d, e,
    output [24:0] out
);

    // Create the "row" vector:
    // Each input is replicated 5 times:
    wire [24:0] row;
    assign row = { {5{a}}, {5{b}}, {5{c}}, {5{d}}, {5{e}} };

    // Create the "column" vector:
    // The 5‐bit group {a,b,c,d,e} is repeated 5 times:
    wire [24:0] col;
    assign col = { {a, b, c, d, e},
                   {a, b, c, d, e},
                   {a, b, c, d, e},
                   {a, b, c, d, e},
                   {a, b, c, d, e} };

    // Bitwise XNOR of the two vectors. Using the ^~ operator
    // produces 1 when the corresponding bits are equal.
    assign out = row ^~ col;

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Changes:
1. The XNOR is now written as row ^~ col rather than using the expression ~row ^ col. Although they are logically equivalent for one‐bit operands, the ^~ operator more clearly indicates an XNOR operation.
2. Intermediate wires (row and col) are introduced to improve code readability.
3. The replication and concatenation operators are used correctly so that both row and col become 25‑bit vectors.

This corrected version follows best coding practices and clearly shows the intended functionality.
