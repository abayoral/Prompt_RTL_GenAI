After close inspection, the module appears to be correctly written. It implements eight D flip-flops with an active-high synchronous reset. On every positive clock edge, if reset is asserted, the 8-bit register q is set to zero; otherwise, it captures the 8-bit input d. Nonblocking assignments (<=) are used correctly inside the clocked always block, and the reset is indeed synchronous (only checked on the posedge clk).

For clarity and best practices, you might consider the following minor improvements:
1. Add a detailed module header comment.
2. Explicitly show that no asynchronous reset is used by leaving it out of the sensitivity list (as youâ€™ve done) and ensuring documentation reflects that.

Below is an annotated version that follows best practices, though functionally it is equivalent to your original code:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,            // Synchronous active-high reset
    input [7:0] d,          // 8-bit data input
    output reg [7:0] q      // 8-bit data output
);

    // On each rising clock edge, check the synchronous reset.
    // If reset is asserted, register q is cleared to 0.
    // Otherwise, register q captures input d.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 8'b0;
        else
            q <= d;
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Since there were no errors found in your original code, no functional corrections were required.
