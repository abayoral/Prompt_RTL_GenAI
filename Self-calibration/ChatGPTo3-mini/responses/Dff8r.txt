After reviewing the code, no functional, syntax, or logical errors were found. The module correctly uses a synchronous reset within an always block triggered on the posedge of clk. The reset clears the register and the data input d is correctly latched into q on every clock cycle when reset is low.

That said, here are a few optional improvements for clarity and maintainability:

1. Explicitly compare the reset signal (e.g., if (reset == 1'b1)) for clarity.
2. Consider adding parameters for the data width (e.g., WIDTH = 8) to make the module more generic.
3. Add descriptive comments that outline the behavior for future maintainers.

Below is an updated version that incorporates these suggestions:

-----------------------------------------------------------
module top_module #(
    parameter WIDTH = 8
)(
    input              clk,
    input              reset,       // Synchronous active-high reset
    input      [WIDTH-1:0] d,
    output reg [WIDTH-1:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset == 1'b1)
            q <= {WIDTH{1'b0}};  // Clear the register
        else
            q <= d;              // Latch the input d into q
    end

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------

If your design does not require these enhancements, the original code is completely acceptable.
