Below is one acceptable “fixed‐and‐improved” version of the module. In our review we found that the original design was essentially correct and synthesized the intended FSM. In the “corrected” version below we have made a few stylistic and best‐practice changes:

• Using localparam for state encodings rather than parameter (so that these constants cannot be inadvertently overridden outside of the module).
• Providing a default next_state assignment.
• Making the done signal update a little clearer.
• Adding some extra comments and white space for clarity.

Note that functionally the changes do not alter the original FSM behavior. (Had there been a functional error the fix would have changed the logic.)

--------------------------------------------------

Explanation of improvements:

1. We replaced the parameters with localparams, which is best practice for internal FSM encoding.
2. The next_state combinational block now initializes next_state to state so that each case branch does not have to assign it in every possible branch.
3. The done signal assignment is done in one if-else statement inside the clocked process (instead of a multi‐branch assignment) to make clear when it is asserted.
4. Additional comments and spacing have been added to clarify operation.

This “fixed” version follows good coding style while preserving the functional behavior of the original design.
