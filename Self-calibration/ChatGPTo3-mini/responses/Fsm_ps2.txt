Below is one acceptable corrected version. The issues fixed include:

• Using SystemVerilog “always_comb” and “always_ff” (best practice) so that the combinational and sequential logic is clearly separated.

• Removing redundant assignments in the state machine and using a more compact style.

• Using a continuous assignment for the “done” output (which is purely combinational).

Here is the revised module:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input  logic       clk,
    input  logic [7:0] in,
    input  logic       reset, // synchronous reset
    output logic       done
);

    // Define states using SystemVerilog enum
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        WAIT  = 2'd0,  // waiting for a byte with bit[3]==1 (message start)
        BYTE1 = 2'd1,  // first byte accepted, waiting for second byte
        BYTE2 = 2'd2,  // second byte accepted, waiting for third byte
        DONE  = 2'd3   // third byte received, signal done
    } state_t;

    state_t state, next_state;

    // Combinational state transition logic
    always_comb begin
        case(state)
            WAIT:  next_state = in[3] ? BYTE1 : WAIT;
            BYTE1: next_state = BYTE2;  // Accept second byte unconditionally
            BYTE2: next_state = DONE;   // Accept third byte unconditionally and assert done next
            DONE:  next_state = WAIT;   // After done, restart the message search
            default: next_state = WAIT;
        endcase
    end

    // Sequential state update (synchronous reset)
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            state <= WAIT;
        else
            state <= next_state;
    end

    // Output logic: assert done for one clock cycle when in DONE state
    assign done = (state == DONE);

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Explanation of corrections:

1. The original code used “always @(*)” and “always @(posedge clk)” along with SystemVerilog enum; the revised code uses “always_comb” and “always_ff” to clearly distinguish between combinational and clocked logic.

2. The output “done” is now driven by a continuous assign because its value depends solely on the registered state.

3. The use of SystemVerilog data types (logic, typedef enum) is maintained, which is acceptable when using SystemVerilog.

This version adheres to best practices and meets the design intent while avoiding potential synthesis or simulation issues.
