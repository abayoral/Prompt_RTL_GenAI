The code you provided is functionally correct and synthesizable. It reverses the bits of a 100‐bit input and assigns the result to a 100‐bit output using a for loop inside an always block. However, there are a couple of style improvements and alternative coding styles that may be preferred:

1. Combinational Logic Best Practice:  
   When describing combinational logic, you could use a continuous assignment with a generate loop. This avoids the need for an always block and the associated blocking assignments. This method is often preferred for purely combinational circuits.

2. Code Clarity:  
   Although your use of an always block is correct in this case, if the logic is purely combinational (and no registers are intended), an assignment using generate creates a more concise description of how each bit is assigned.

Below are two corrected versions.

────────────────────────────   
Version 1: Using an Always Block (Your Original Intent)

This version uses an always block and a loop. Note that this is functionally equivalent to your original code, with only minor reformatting for clarity.

---------------------------------------------------
module top_module( 
    input  [99:0] in,
    output reg [99:0] out
);
    integer i;
    
    always @* begin
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin
            out[i] = in[99 - i];
        end
    end
endmodule
---------------------------------------------------

────────────────────────────   
Version 2: Using a Generate Block with Continuous Assignment

This version uses a generate loop with continuous assignments. Since the logic is combinational, we declare the output as a wire and use the generate construct. This style is also synthesizable and considered clean for combinatorial circuits.

---------------------------------------------------
module top_module( 
    input  [99:0] in,
    output [99:0] out
);
    genvar i;
    generate
        for(i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin : bit_reversal
            assign out[i] = in[99 - i];
        end
    endgenerate
endmodule
---------------------------------------------------

────────────────────────────   
Both versions are correct. You can choose the style that best fits your coding guidelines and design style.
