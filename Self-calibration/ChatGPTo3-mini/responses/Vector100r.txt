The original code is functionally correct—it reverses the bits of the 100‐bit input and assigns them to the output. There are no logical or synthesis errors. However, to follow best practices and ensure clarity, you might consider a couple of minor improvements:

1. Explicitly define the port directions (e.g., using "input wire" instead of just "input") to improve readability.
2. Declare the loop variable within the always block (although it’s also common to declare it at the module level).

Below is a revised version that incorporates these suggestions:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input wire [99:0] in,
    output reg [99:0] out
);
    
    always @(*) begin
        integer i;
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin
            out[i] = in[99 - i];
        end
    end
endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

In this version, the loop variable “i” is declared within the always block, ensuring that its scope is limited to the block. This adheres to common best practices without altering the intended functionality of the original module.
