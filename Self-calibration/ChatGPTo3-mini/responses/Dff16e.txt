Below is an annotated version of the original module. Functionally, the code performs as expected. It implements a 16‑bit register with two byte‐enable signals so that on a clock edge, only the corresponding byte (if enabled) is updated. In other words, if byteena[0] is high, bits [7:0] of q are updated and if byteena[1] is high, bits [15:8] are updated.

Although the code is correct, there are a couple of points you might consider:

1. Reset Type:  
   The given reset (resetn) is used synchronously (inside an always block sensitive only to posedge clk). Often, an active‐low reset is used asynchronously. If you intend for your reset to take effect immediately when asserted, you can include it in the sensitivity list (using “or negedge resetn”). If you really want a synchronous reset then the current code is fine.

2. Code Style/Readability:  
   Although it is not a syntax error, you might wrap single statements in begin…end blocks for clarity, especially if you later add more code in that branch.

Below are two corrected versions—one leaving the reset synchronous, and one changing it to asynchronous—so you can choose the one that best fits your design requirements.

1) Synchronous Reset (No change to functional behavior)

module top_module (
    input         clk,
    input         resetn,
    input  [1:0]  byteena,
    input  [15:0] d,
    output reg [15:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (!resetn) begin
            q <= 16'b0;
        end else begin
            if (byteena[0]) begin
                q[7:0] <= d[7:0];
            end
            if (byteena[1]) begin
                q[15:8] <= d[15:8];
            end
        end
    end

endmodule

2) Asynchronous Reset (if that is the intended behavior)

module top_module (
    input         clk,
    input         resetn,
    input  [1:0]  byteena,
    input  [15:0] d,
    output reg [15:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk or negedge resetn) begin
        if (!resetn) begin
            q <= 16'b0;
        end else begin
            if (byteena[0]) begin
                q[7:0] <= d[7:0];
            end
            if (byteena[1]) begin
                q[15:8] <= d[15:8];
            end
        end
    end

endmodule

In summary, there was no “error” in your code; it simply depends on whether you need a synchronous or asynchronous reset. The provided revisions follow best practices and improve code clarity.
