I reviewed the code and found no errors—logically, syntactically, or functionally. The module correctly compares two 3‐bit numbers and ensures that only one output (A_equal, A_greater, or A_less) is high at a time.

That said, here are a few suggestions to follow best practices:

1. Explicitly declare the ports as type “wire” (even though they default to wire for continuous assignments).
2. Add comments for clarity.  
3. Optionally, include a header comment for module documentation.

Below is the slightly revised version incorporating these suggestions:

------------------------------------------------------------
module comparator_3bit(
    input  wire [2:0] A,      // 3-bit input A
    input  wire [2:0] B,      // 3-bit input B
    output wire       A_greater,  // High if A > B
    output wire       A_equal,    // High if A == B
    output wire       A_less      // High if A < B
);

    // Combinational logic to determine the relationship between A and B.
    // Exactly one of the outputs will be high.
    assign A_equal   = (A == B);
    assign A_greater = (A > B);
    assign A_less    = (A < B);

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

This version adheres to best practices and retains the intended functionality.
