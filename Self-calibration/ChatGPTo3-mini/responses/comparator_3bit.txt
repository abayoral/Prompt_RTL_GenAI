The provided Verilog module is functionally and syntactically correct. It implements a 3‑bit comparator that produces three outputs (A_greater, A_equal, and A_less) using combinational continuous assignments, and these are standard, synthesizable constructs.

That said, here are a few best‐practice suggestions you might consider:

1. Include a timescale directive (often used in simulation).
2. Add comments describing the module’s functionality.
3. Optionally, you might group the outputs in a single bus or optimize the logic if needed, but that isn’t necessary here.

Below is the "corrected" version that integrates these best practices:

------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module comparator_3bit(
    input  [2:0] A,
    input  [2:0] B,
    output       A_greater,
    output       A_equal,
    output       A_less
);
    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Description:
    //   Compares two 3-bit numbers A and B:
    //     - A_greater is high if A is greater than B.
    //     - A_equal   is high if A is equal to B.
    //     - A_less    is high if A is less than B.
    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    // Combinational logic for comparison
    assign A_greater = (A > B);
    assign A_equal   = (A == B);
    assign A_less    = (A < B);

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

In summary, the original design is correct, and the above version simply enhances readability and simulation setup.
