Below is one acceptable corrected version. The issue with the original code is that it uses a variable bit‐select—“in[sel]”—on a 256‐bit vector. In plain Verilog (pre–SystemVerilog) a bit-select must be a constant expression, so using a variable (sel) can cause synthesis or simulation problems. There are two common ways to fix this:

1. Use SystemVerilog. SystemVerilog supports variable bit-selects. In that case, it’s best practice to use SystemVerilog’s types (e.g. logic) and choose signal names that avoid any potential confusion with reserved words. For example:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns/1ps
module top_module(
    input  logic [255:0] in_signal, // renamed from "in" for clarity
    input  logic [7:0]   sel,
    output logic         out
);

    // Variable bit-select is allowed in SystemVerilog:
    assign out = in_signal[sel];

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------------

2. Stay with plain Verilog and implement a multiplexer. In plain Verilog you cannot use a variable index in a continuous assignment. Instead you can write a combinational always block with a case statement. (Note that for a 256‐bit multiplexer, the case statement becomes very large and might not be practical to write out manually, so using SystemVerilog is recommended.) For example:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns/1ps
module top_module(
    input  [255:0] in_signal, // renamed from "in"
    input  [7:0]   sel,
    output reg     out
);

    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            8'd0:   out = in_signal[0];
            8'd1:   out = in_signal[1];
            // …
            // You would need to list all 256 cases here
            // …
            default: out = 1'b0;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Because the multiplexer case statement for 256 cases is unwieldy, the SystemVerilog solution is generally preferred.
