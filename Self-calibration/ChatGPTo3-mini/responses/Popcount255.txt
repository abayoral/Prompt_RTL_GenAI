Below is an improved version of your code. Technically your original code does work correctly; however, for clarity and best coding practices it’s often advisable to enclose the body of the for‐loop within begin…end and to properly indent your code. In addition, a comment can help explain that the summation is counting 1’s. Here’s the revised version:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module( 
    input  [254:0] in,
    output [7:0]   out 
);

    reg [7:0] count;
    integer   i;
    
    always @(*) begin
        // Initialize count to 0 and sum all individual bits in 'in'
        count = 8'd0;
        for (i = 0; i < 255; i = i + 1) begin
            count = count + in[i];
        end
    end

    assign out = count;

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Notes:
1. The loop correctly iterates 255 times (since in is 255 bits wide) and since the max number of bits set is 255, an 8‑bit counter is sufficient.
2. Although your original code used a single statement in the loop (which is allowed), it is good practice to always use begin/end blocks when writing loops so that future modifications are less error prone.

This revised version adheres to best practices while performing the exact same combinational logic as your original code.
