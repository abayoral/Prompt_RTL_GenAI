Below is one acceptable corrected version of the code. Functionally nothing was “wrong” with your implementation, but there were a few style and best‐practice issues that can be improved:

• It is better to use consistent naming conventions (e.g. lower case for clock and reset).
• There’s no need to “hold” a register by assigning it to itself in a clocked always block.
• The hours register only needs 5 bits (0–23) so using 6 bits is more than necessary (though not an error).
• Using intermediate “flag” signals (optional) can improve readability.

Below is the revised code with these improvements:

------------------------------------------------
module calendar(
   input wire clk,
   input wire rst,
   output reg [5:0] secs,  // 0 to 59: 6 bits is correct
   output reg [5:0] mins,  // 0 to 59: 6 bits is correct
   output reg [4:0] hours  // 0 to 23: 5 bits is sufficient
);

  // Seconds counter: counts 0 → 59 then wraps to 0.
  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
      secs <= 6'd0;
    else if (secs == 6'd59)
      secs <= 6'd0;
    else
      secs <= secs + 6'd1;
  end

  // Minutes counter: increments when seconds complete a cycle (i.e. reached 59).
  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
      mins <= 6'd0;
    else if (secs == 6'd59) begin
      if (mins == 6'd59)
        mins <= 6'd0;
      else
        mins <= mins + 6'd1;
    end
    // No else branch needed; mins retains its value.
  end

  // Hours counter: increments when seconds and minutes both finished their cycles.
  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
      hours <= 5'd0;
    else if ((secs == 6'd59) && (mins == 6'd59)) begin
      if (hours == 5'd23)
        hours <= 5'd0;
      else
        hours <= hours + 5'd1;
    end
    // No else branch needed; hours retains its value.
  end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

Key points in this corrected version:

1. We use consistent signal naming (clk, rst).
2. We removed redundant “hold” assignments (the registers automatically hold their value when not updated).
3. We sized the hours register to 5 bits since it only needs to count up to 23.
4. All registers have an asynchronous reset; if you prefer a synchronous reset, that style can be adopted instead.

This version adheres to good Verilog design practices while implementing the same functionality as your original code.
