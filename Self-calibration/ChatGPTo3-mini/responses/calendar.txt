Below is one corrected and improved version. The original code “worked” in that it compiled and simulated, but its minute‐and‐hour update conditions depended directly on registers (Secs and Mins) that are updated concurrently. This can lead to “off‐by one” or timing ambiguities. A preferred approach is to generate “tick” carry signals (based on the previous cycle’s values) and use them to update minutes and hours. Also, note that hours need only five bits (0–23) rather than six. The corrected code appears below:

------------------------------------------------------------
module calendar(
    input  wire       CLK,
    input  wire       RST,
    output reg [5:0]  Secs,
    output reg [5:0]  Mins,
    output reg [4:0]  Hours  // 0 to 23 requires 5 bits.
);

  // Generate a tick when seconds or minutes have reached their maximum values.
  wire sec_tick = (Secs == 6'd59);
  wire min_tick = sec_tick && (Mins == 6'd59);

  // Seconds counter: counts from 0 to 59, then resets.
  always @(posedge CLK or posedge RST) begin
    if (RST)
      Secs <= 6'd0;
    else if (sec_tick)
      Secs <= 6'd0;
    else
      Secs <= Secs + 6'd1;
  end

  // Minutes counter: increments when a seconds tick occurs.
  always @(posedge CLK or posedge RST) begin
    if (RST)
      Mins <= 6'd0;
    else if (sec_tick) begin
      if (Mins == 6'd59)
        Mins <= 6'd0;
      else
        Mins <= Mins + 6'd1;
    end
    // else: no assignment needed, register keeps its value
  end

  // Hours counter: increments when a minute tick occurs.
  always @(posedge CLK or posedge RST) begin
    if (RST)
      Hours <= 5'd0;
    else if (min_tick) begin
      if (Hours == 5'd23)
        Hours <= 5'd0;
      else
        Hours <= Hours + 5'd1;
    end
    // else: no assignment needed, register keeps its value
  end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Key corrections and improvements:
1. Introduced internal wires (sec_tick and min_tick) so that minute- and hour‐increments occur based on the previous cycle’s fully valid counter values.
2. Reduced the width of Hours to 5 bits (since 24 hours fits in 5 bits).
3. Removed redundant “else” assignments that simply held the previous value (the register naturally holds its value when not updated in a clocked always block).

This version adheres to best practices by not “mixing” combinational logic in sequential processes and avoids unintended dependencies between simultaneously updated registers.
