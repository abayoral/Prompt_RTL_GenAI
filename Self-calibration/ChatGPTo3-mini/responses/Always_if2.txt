Below is an improved version of your module. In fact, the original code is functionally correct and synthesizes without error. However, a few improvements can be made for clarity and best practices:

1. For simple combinational logic, you can use continuous assignments instead of always blocks. This reduces boilerplate and makes the intent clear.
2. When using always blocks for combinational logic, it’s a good practice to assign default values at the beginning of the block—even though every branch is covered—to prevent any accidental latch inference if modifications are made later.
3. For clarity, using 1'b1 and 1'b0 for constant assignments is common practice, though not strictly necessary.

Below are two corrected versions—one using continuous assignment and the other using always blocks with default assignments.

Version 1: Using Continuous Assignments

module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output     shut_off_computer,
    output     keep_driving
);

    // Shut off computer when the CPU is overheated.
    assign shut_off_computer = cpu_overheated;
    
    // Keep driving if not arrived and the gas tank is not empty.
    // Invert the condition to drive when appropriate.
    assign keep_driving = ~(arrived || gas_tank_empty);

endmodule

Version 2: Using Always Blocks with Default Assignments

module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    // Always block to determine when to shut off the computer.
    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignment
        shut_off_computer = 1'b0;
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1'b1;
    end

    // Always block to determine whether to keep driving.
    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignment
        keep_driving = 1'b1;
        if (arrived || gas_tank_empty)
            keep_driving = 1'b0;
    end

endmodule

Both versions are functionally equivalent; choose the style that best fits your design methodology.
