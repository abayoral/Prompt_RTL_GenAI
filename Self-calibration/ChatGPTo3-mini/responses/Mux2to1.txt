The given Verilog module is correct both syntactically and functionally for implementing a 2-to-1 multiplexer. The code:

  module top_module(  
    input a,  
    input b,  
    input sel,  
    output out  
  );  
    // 2-to-1 multiplexer: when sel==0 choose a, when sel==1 choose b.  
    assign out = sel ? b : a;  
  endmodule

works as intended with no logical errors. However, here are a few best practice suggestions:

1. Consistently style your code formatting.
2. Adding a time scale directive (if needed) for simulation consistency.
3. Consider declaring I/O widths explicitly if you plan to extend the design later.

Below is the code with minor style improvements:

--------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire sel,
    output wire out
);
    // 2-to-1 multiplexer: when sel==0 choose a, when sel==1 choose b.
    assign out = sel ? b : a;
    
endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

These changes improve readability and prepare the module for larger scale designs, but they are not corrections per se since your original code was already correct.
