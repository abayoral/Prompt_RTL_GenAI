Below is one corrected and slightly refactored version of the module. In your original code there wasn’t any outright syntax or logical “bug” in the sequential time‐keeping part. However, the following improvements are recommended:

1. Clarify reset behavior by comparing to a 1‐bit constant.
2. Improve comments and formatting for readability.
3. Although many simulators support division (/) and modulus (%) for constant divisors, these operations can be expensive or even unsupported in some synthesis flows. In a production design you might want to avoid them (for example by using a dedicated BCD conversion or a combinational subtraction–based conversion). In this corrected version the conversions are left as in your original design but with a comment noting this.

Below is the corrected code:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input        clk,
    input        reset,  // Synchronous active-high reset.
    input        ena,    // One-second tick enable.
    output       pm,     // AM/PM indicator: 0 = AM, 1 = PM.
    output [7:0] hh,     // Two-digit BCD hour.
    output [7:0] mm,     // Two-digit BCD minute.
    output [7:0] ss      // Two-digit BCD second.
);

    // Internal counters:
    // sec_reg and min_reg are 6‐bit registers required to count 0 to 59.
    // hr_reg is a 4‐bit register that holds hours (valid range: 1..12).
    reg [5:0] sec_reg, min_reg;
    reg [3:0] hr_reg;  // Hours: 1 through 12.
    reg       pm_reg;  // 0 for AM, 1 for PM.

    // Main synchronous block.
    // Reset has highest priority; then if ena is high we increment time.
    // Note: the reset is synchronous (only checked at posedge clk).
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset == 1'b1) begin
            sec_reg <= 6'd0;
            min_reg <= 6'd0;
            hr_reg  <= 4'd12;  // Reset to 12:00:00
            pm_reg  <= 1'b0;   // AM
        end 
        else if (ena) begin
            // Seconds counter.
            if (sec_reg == 6'd59) begin
                sec_reg <= 6'd0;
                // Minutes counter.
                if (min_reg == 6'd59) begin
                    min_reg <= 6'd0;
                    // Hour update:
                    // For a standard 12‐hour clock:
                    //   11:59:59 --> 12:00:00 (toggle AM/PM)
                    //   12:59:59 --> 01:00:00 (no toggle)
                    if (hr_reg == 4'd11) begin
                        hr_reg <= 4'd12;
                        pm_reg <= ~pm_reg;  // Toggle period.
                    end 
                    else if (hr_reg == 4'd12) begin
                        hr_reg <= 4'd1;     // Transition from 12 to 1.
                    end 
                    else begin
                        hr_reg <= hr_reg + 4'd1;
                    end
                end 
                else begin
                    min_reg <= min_reg + 6'd1;
                end
            end 
            else begin
                sec_reg <= sec_reg + 6'd1;
            end
        end
    end

    // BCD Conversion:
    // For mm and ss the conversion is straightforward, as the values range from 0 to 59.
    // Note: The use of division and modulus (/) and (%) can be resource‐expensive
    // for synthesis. In non‐critical applications or for simulation, it is acceptable.
    
    // Seconds conversion.
    wire [3:0] ss_tens = sec_reg / 6'd10;
    wire [3:0] ss_ones = sec_reg % 6'd10;
    assign ss = {ss_tens, ss_ones};
    
    // Minutes conversion.
    wire [3:0] mm_tens = min_reg / 6'd10;
    wire [3:0] mm_ones = min_reg % 6'd10;
    assign mm = {mm_tens, mm_ones};

    // Hours conversion:
    // Since valid hour values are 1–12, if hr_reg is less than 10,
    // the tens digit is 0; otherwise (i.e. for 10, 11, or 12),
    // the tens digit is 1 and the ones digit is hr_reg minus 10.
    wire [3:0] hr_tens = (hr_reg < 4'd10) ? 4'd0 : 4'd1;
    wire [3:0] hr_ones = (hr_reg < 4'd10) ? hr_reg : (hr_reg - 4'd10);
    assign hh = {hr_tens, hr_ones};

    // Assign the period indicator.
    assign pm = pm_reg;

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Key Points in the Corrected Version:

• The sequential always block cleanly separates reset and enable functionality.
• Comments have been expanded to explain the design intent.
• A note about division/modulus is given in case you wish to replace those operators for synthesis.

This version follows best practices while keeping the original functionality intact.
