Below is one acceptable “fixed‐up” version. Note that the original code was mostly correct from a Verilog‐syntax point of view. However, one potential functional issue is that valid_out is only driven when cnt==0 so that once it is asserted it remains high (because it is never explicitly de‐asserted). In many designs you want valid_out to be high only during the 4‐cycle conversion so that it goes low between conversions. (If you really want it to remain high all the time, then the original code is “correct”.) 

In the version below I show one way to load the parallel data when cnt is 0 and then de‐assert valid_out when the last serial bit is being output. I also make a few style changes (for example, using a ternary operator for the counter update) that are generally considered best practice.

----------------------------------------------------------------
module parallel2serial(
    input         clk,
    input         rst_n,
    input  [3:0]  d,
    output        dout,
    output reg    valid_out
);

    // Internal registers
    reg [1:0] cnt;       // 2-bit counter to count from 0 to 3
    reg [3:0] d_reg;     // Register to hold the parallel data

    // Serial output: select bit from d_reg based on cnt.
    // Mapping: when cnt==0, output MSB d_reg[3]; then d_reg[2], d_reg[1], and LSB d_reg[0].
    assign dout = d_reg[3 - cnt];

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            cnt       <= 2'b00;
            d_reg     <= 4'b0000;
            valid_out <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            // When we are at the beginning of the conversion (cnt==0) load the new parallel data.
            if (cnt == 2'b00) begin
                d_reg     <= d;
                valid_out <= 1'b1;  // Assert valid_out at the start of the conversion.
            end else if (cnt == 2'b11) begin
                valid_out <= 1'b0;  // Deassert valid_out on the cycle when the last bit is output.
            end

            // Update counter (wrap back to 0 after 3)
            cnt <= (cnt == 2'b11) ? 2'b00 : cnt + 1'b1;
        end
    end

endmodule
----------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the Changes:
1. valid_out is now also de‐asserted (set to 0) when cnt equals 3 so that it is high only during the 4‐cycle conversion.
2. The counter update is written using the ternary operator for clarity.
3. Comments have been updated to clarify the functionality.

This version adheres to good coding practices and meets common design requirements while keeping “security” (i.e. proper reset conditions and clear control of signals) in mind.
