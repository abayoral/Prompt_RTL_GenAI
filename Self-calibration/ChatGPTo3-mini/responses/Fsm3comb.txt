Below is an annotated version of your code with a few minor clean‐ups for clarity and best practices. Functionally the original code was correct; however, the revised version makes the following improvements:

1. It uses default assignments at the beginning of the always block. This style prevents any accidental latch inference and clarifies that every branch assigns a value.

2. It renames the input “state” to “current_state” (this is optional but can help readability, as “state” is also used for the FSM’s internal state).

3. It consolidates the default “out” assignment where possible so that only the branch that changes the output value needs to override it.

Below is a corrected version of the module:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input        in,
    input  [1:0] current_state,  // Renamed for clarity
    output reg [1:0] next_state,
    output reg       out
);

    // Define states
    parameter A = 2'b00,
              B = 2'b01,
              C = 2'b10,
              D = 2'b11;

    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignments to prevent latches
        next_state = current_state;
        out        = 1'b0;

        case(current_state)
            A: begin
                if (in == 1'b0)
                    next_state = A;
                else
                    next_state = B;
            end

            B: begin
                if (in == 1'b0)
                    next_state = C;
                else
                    next_state = B;
            end

            C: begin
                if (in == 1'b0)
                    next_state = A;
                else
                    next_state = D;
            end

            D: begin
                // In state D, out is asserted
                out = 1'b1;
                if (in == 1'b0)
                    next_state = C;
                else
                    next_state = B;
            end

            default: begin
                next_state = A;
                // out remains 1'b0 by default
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Key Changes:
• Default Assignments – By assigning default values for next_state and out at the start of the always block, we ensure that every possible branch of the case statement has defined outputs, eliminating any risk of latch inference.
• Naming – Renaming the state input to current_state makes the role of that signal clear.
• Consistency – The control flow remains the same as your original design, but having a default “out” and “next_state” avoids repetitious assignments.

This version should be functionally equivalent to your original module while following improved Verilog coding practices.
