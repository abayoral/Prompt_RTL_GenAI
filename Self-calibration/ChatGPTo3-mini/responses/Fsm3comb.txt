Below is a revised version of your module. Although your original code is largely correct, the following improvements make the design more robust and easier to maintain:

1. Default assignments are added at the beginning of the combinational block. This helps prevent accidental latch inference if later modifications cause a missing assignment.

2. The formatting is slightly cleaned up, and comparisons to a one‐bit signal are simplified. (Using “if (in)” or “if (!in)” makes the code more concise while keeping it clear.)

Here’s the updated code:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input        in,
    input  [1:0] state,
    output reg [1:0] next_state,
    output reg   out
);

    // Parameter definitions for states
    parameter A = 2'b00,
              B = 2'b01,
              C = 2'b10,
              D = 2'b11;

    // Combinational block: default assignments prevent latches
    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignment: can be overwritten in each case branch
        next_state = state;
        out        = 1'b0;

        case (state)
            A: begin
                if (!in)
                    next_state = A;
                else
                    next_state = B;
                // out remains 0
            end

            B: begin
                if (!in)
                    next_state = C;
                else
                    next_state = B;
                // out remains 0
            end

            C: begin
                if (!in)
                    next_state = A;
                else
                    next_state = D;
                // out remains 0
            end

            D: begin
                if (!in)
                    next_state = C;
                else
                    next_state = B;
                out = 1'b1;
            end

            default: begin
                next_state = A;  // Fallback to A on undefined state.
                // out remains 0 by default assignment
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Key Notes:

• The default assignments (next_state = state; out = 0;) at the start of the always block guarantee that every output is assigned regardless of which branch is taken.
  
• Using the simplified if statement (if (!in) for in equal to 0) improves readability.

This version adheres to best practices for combinational logic design in Verilog and ensures that no unintended latches will be inferred.
