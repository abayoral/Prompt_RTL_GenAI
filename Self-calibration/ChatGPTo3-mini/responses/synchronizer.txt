Below is one correct way to “fix” the design. Although many tools will synthesize the original code without error, the following version improves the design in two ways:

1. It addresses the “three‑cycle” requirement by using a three‑stage synchronizer (instead of two) on the enable signal in the clk_b domain. This ensures that the enable signal coming from clk_a has been stable for three clk_b cycles before updating the output.

2. It “synchronizes” the multi‑bit data by capturing it into a separate register (data_buf) in the clk_b domain. (When crossing clock domains, it is best practice not to directly use a multi‑bit signal captured in one clock domain in the destination domain—even if the related “enable” has been synchronized—because metastability risk still exists on its edges.)

In many designs one simply “assumes” that data_reg is stable because data_en is held high long enough. However, robust clock‐domain crossing will re‑capture the data in the destination domain. (An alternative acceptable approach is to use a handshake or FIFO scheme.)

The corrected code follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------
module synchronizer(
    input         clk_a,      // clock for data and enable capture
    input         clk_b,      // clock for output synchronization
    input         arstn,      // asynchronous reset for clk_a domain (active low)
    input         brstn,      // asynchronous reset for clk_b domain (active low)
    input  [3:0]  data_in,    // 4-bit input data
    input         data_en,    // enable signal: must be high for ≥3 clk_b cycles before transfer
    output reg [3:0] dataout  // 4-bit synchronized output data
);

  // Internal register in the clk_a domain.
  // data_reg latches the incoming data when data_en is asserted.
  reg [3:0] data_reg;
  reg       en_data_reg;

  // clk_b domain three‐stage synchronizer for the enable signal
  reg en_sync1;
  reg en_sync2;
  reg en_sync3;
  
  // Optional: A data synchronization stage for safe clock-domain crossing.
  // This captures data_reg into clk_b domain.
  reg [3:0] data_buf;

  // clk_a domain: Capture data and data enable.
  // Use asynchronous reset (active‐low)
  always @(posedge clk_a or negedge arstn) begin
    if (!arstn) begin
      data_reg    <= 4'b0;
      en_data_reg <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      // Capture data_in when data_en is high; otherwise retain previous value.
      if (data_en)
        data_reg <= data_in;
      // Latch the data_en from clk_a domain.
      en_data_reg <= data_en;
    end
  end

  // clk_b domain: Synchronize the enable signal over three cycles and update output data.
  // Also capture the asynchronous data_reg into a buffer.
  always @(posedge clk_b or negedge brstn) begin
    if (!brstn) begin
      en_sync1  <= 1'b0;
      en_sync2  <= 1'b0;
      en_sync3  <= 1'b0;
      data_buf  <= 4'b0;
      dataout   <= 4'b0;
    end else begin
      // Three clock cycle synchronizer for the enable signal.
      en_sync1 <= en_data_reg;
      en_sync2 <= en_sync1;
      en_sync3 <= en_sync2;

      // When the synchronized enable has been high for three clk_b cycles, capture data_reg.
      if (en_sync3)
        data_buf <= data_reg;

      // Transfer the buffered data to the output.
      dataout <= data_buf;
    end
  end

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the changes:

• In the first always block (clk_a domain) we latch data_in into data_reg only when data_en is high. The enable is also latched into en_data_reg (this is then safe to send across clock domains).

• In the second always block (clk_b domain) a three–flip-flop synchronizer (en_sync1, en_sync2, en_sync3) is used on en_data_reg to guarantee that the enable was asserted continuously for at least three clk_b cycles. Only when that condition is met do we capture the asynchronous data_reg into a local data_buf. Finally, data_buf is used to drive the output dataout.

This solution follows common best practices for clock-domain crossings and meets the requirement that the transfer enable must be held high for three clk_b cycles before dataout is updated.
