The provided code is already correct in terms of syntax and functionality. It implements a simple 4‐bit counter with a synchronous active‐high reset, and it uses nonblocking assignments (<=) correctly.

However, here are a few best-practice suggestions and minor enhancements:

1. Comment Clarity: Although your comment indicates a synchronous active-high reset, you could include a brief note about the counter wrapping behavior, since a 4-bit counter will naturally roll over from 15 to 0.
2. Code Formatting: Some designers prefer to write binary numbers with all four bits defined for clarity (e.g., 4'b0000 instead of 4'b0). This is a stylistic preference and not required.
3. Consistency: Ensure that your file includes a proper header or module documentation if used in larger designs.

Below is the code with these minor stylistic improvements:

------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,          // Synchronous active-high reset
    output reg [3:0] q    // 4-bit counter
);

    // On each clock edge, if reset is high, clear the counter; 
    // otherwise, increment it. The counter wraps from 15 back to 0.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 4'b0000;
        else
            q <= q + 1;
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

In summary, the original code was functionally correct; the changes above are purely for clarity and adherence to common coding style guidelines.
