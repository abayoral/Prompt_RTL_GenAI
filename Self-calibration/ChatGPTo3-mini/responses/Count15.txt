After reviewing the module, no functional or syntax errors were found. The module correctly implements a 4‐bit counter with a synchronous active‐high reset, and the operations (nonblocking assignment, use of posedge clk, and proper bus widths) all adhere to common best practices.

For completeness, here are a few optional enhancements and clarifications that you might consider:

1. Commenting and Parameterization:  
   You might define a parameter for the counter's maximum value or its width to facilitate easier changes in the future.

2. Default Reset Value:  
   Although your synchronous reset initializes the register correctly, sometimes it’s useful to also define an initial block (if supported by your synthesis flow or for simulation) to set a known value when starting a simulation.

Below is your original module with optional enhancements included as comments:

-------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,      // Synchronous active-high reset
    output reg [3:0] q
);

// Optional parameter for counter width (for scalability)
// parameter WIDTH = 4;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset)
        q <= 4'b0000;
    else
        q <= q + 1;
end

// Optional: initial block for simulation purposes only
// initial begin
//      q = 4'b0000;
// end

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------------------

In summary, your original code is error-free and functionally correct. The optional modifications above are provided only to give you ideas for additional improvements based on design context and simulation needs.
