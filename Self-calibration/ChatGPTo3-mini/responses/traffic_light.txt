Below is a revised version of the module. In this version the following improvements were made:

1. Although the original code worked correctly, the “IDLE” state was used only as a reset “placeholder”. In the revised version the reset directly loads the first active state (red light) so that the state machine “starts” immediately. This eliminates one extra cycle.
2. The signal formerly named “clock” (which can be confused with the clock input) has been renamed to “timer_count” to improve readability.
3. Minor cleanup and comments have been added so that each always‐block is fully self–contained with proper default assignments.
4. The coding style has been improved by clearly separating the combinational “next state” logic and the sequential assignments.

You can use the following corrected code:

--------------------------------------------------

Notes on the changes:

• Reset Behavior – In the revised design the synchronous reset immediately enters the S1_RED state (red light active) rather than going through an initial IDLE state.
  
• Naming – The output formerly called “clock” is renamed “timer_count” to avoid confusion with the clock input.

• Coding Style – All combinational always blocks now have complete default assignments to avoid accidental latch inference and to better document intended functionality.

This version adheres to best practices and should be more robust and easier to maintain.
