Below is one acceptable corrected version. Although the original code “worked,” there were a few stylistic and potential race‐condition issues that are best avoided. In our version we combine the state/counter and output updates into a single always block. This way the traffic light outputs are updated in the very same clock cycle as the state and counter logic. (Note that another acceptable fix is to use separate always blocks but then care must be taken to avoid reading stale state.) We have also added some comments and default assignments for clarity. One might also wish to rename the 8‐bit output “clock” to something less “clock‐like” (such as “count” or “cnt_disp”) to avoid confusion—but we keep the original name here.

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the main changes:

1. Combined the state/counter update, the countdown output update, and the traffic light output update into one always block. This avoids any potential race conditions where separate clocked blocks might see “old” state values.

2. Added explicit default branches in the state and output case statements so that synthesis tools have a complete view of all possibilities.

3. Used nonblocking assignments consistently and ensured that constant widths (e.g. 8'd0, 8'd10) are used when comparing or assigning to our 8‐bit signals.

This version adheres to good Verilog coding practices and avoids the subtle pitfalls that sometimes come from having multiple always blocks sharing related state.
