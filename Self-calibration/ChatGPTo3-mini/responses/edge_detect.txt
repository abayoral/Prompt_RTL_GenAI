The provided Verilog module for edge detection is logically sound and synthesizable as written. It correctly detects the rising edge (when a transitions from 0 to 1) and the falling edge (when a transitions from 1 to 0) using a registered copy of the input "a" (prev_a) and asynchronous reset. However, a few minor improvements can be made to enhance readability and ensure consistency with best practices. Hereâ€™s a revised version with detailed comments:

--------------------------------------------------
module edge_detect (
    input  wire clk,    // Clock signal
    input  wire rst_n,  // Active-low reset signal
    input  wire a,      // Input signal to monitor
    output reg  rise,   // Rising edge detection output
    output reg  down    // Falling edge detection output
);

    // Register to hold the previous state of input 'a'
    reg prev_a;

    // On every rising edge of the clock or when reset is asserted,
    // update the outputs and the stored previous state.
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        // Active low reset: initialize stored state and outputs to 0
        if (!rst_n) begin
            prev_a <= 1'b0;
            rise   <= 1'b0;
            down   <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            // Detect rising edge: previous 'a' was 0 and current 'a' is 1
            rise <= (~prev_a & a);
            // Detect falling edge: previous 'a' was 1 and current 'a' is 0
            down <= (prev_a & ~a);
            // Update previous state for the next cycle
            prev_a <= a;
        end
    end

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Changes/Notes:

1. Added explicit "wire" to input declarations for clarity.
2. Reordered comments and added annotations to improve readability.
3. Retained nonblocking assignments for proper sequential behavior.
4. The original logic is maintained, ensuring that both the rising and falling edges are correctly detected.

This version adheres to the conventions and best practices of writing robust, synthesizable Verilog code.
