Below is the updated Verilog module with a minor improvement. Although your original code was mostly correct, one common pitfall is the initialization of the stored signal (a_prev) during reset. If a is high when the reset deasserts, initializing a_prev to 0 would cause a spurious rising‐edge pulse immediately after reset. In many systems, you want the edge‐detector to be inactive until a proper change happens; you can achieve that by setting a_prev to the current value of a during reset.

Below is the corrected version following best practices:

----------------------------------------------------
module edge_detect (
    input clk,         // Clock signal
    input rst_n,       // Active low reset
    input a,           // 1-bit input signal to monitor edges
    output reg rise,   // Pulses high for one clock cycle on rising edge of 'a'
    output reg down    // Pulses high for one clock cycle on falling edge of 'a'
);

    // Register to store previous state of signal a
    reg a_prev;

    // Edge detection process: asynchronous reset, synchronous operation
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            // On reset, initialize a_prev to the current value of 'a' to avoid spurious pulses.
            a_prev <= a;
            rise   <= 1'b0;
            down   <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            // Generate a one-clock pulse for a rising edge: current a is 1 and previous was 0.
            rise <= a & ~a_prev;
            
            // Generate a one-clock pulse for a falling edge: current a is 0 and previous was 1.
            down <= ~a & a_prev;
            
            // Update the previous state with the current value of a.
            a_prev <= a;
        end
    end

endmodule
----------------------------------------------------

Key Corrections and Best Practices:

1. Reset Initialization: Instead of forcing a_prev to 0 on reset, it is now initialized to a. This prevents an immediate rising edge detection when the system comes out of reset if a is initially high.

2. Combinational Expressions: The assignments for rise and down have been written in a combinational style (using a & ~a_prev and ~a & a_prev) to clearly express the detection logic.

3. Nonblocking Assignments: Nonblocking (<=) assignments are used throughout in the sequential always block, ensuring that all values update correctly at the end of the clock cycle.

This corrected module now adheres to good design practices and should function as intended for edge-detection in your design.
