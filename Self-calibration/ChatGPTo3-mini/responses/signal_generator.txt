Below is the corrected and slightly improved version of your module. Although the original code was functionally correct, the following version uses parameters for the maximum/minimum values and state encoding to improve readability and maintainability. In addition, a case statement is used to clarify the two operating modes:

-----------------------------------------------------------
module signal_generator(
    input        clk,
    input        rst_n,
    output reg [4:0] wave
);

    // Parameters for waveform limits
    parameter MAX_WAVE = 5'd31;
    parameter MIN_WAVE = 5'd0;

    // Encode state values for clarity
    parameter INCREASE = 1'b0,
              DECREASE = 1'b1;

    reg state; // Mode: INCREASE or DECREASE

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            wave  <= MIN_WAVE;
            state <= INCREASE;
        end
        else begin
            case (state)
                INCREASE: begin
                    // If the maximum value is reached, switch direction
                    if (wave == MAX_WAVE) begin
                        state <= DECREASE;
                        wave  <= wave - 5'd1;
                    end
                    else begin
                        wave <= wave + 5'd1;
                    end
                end
                DECREASE: begin
                    // If the minimum value is reached, switch direction
                    if (wave == MIN_WAVE) begin
                        state <= INCREASE;
                        wave  <= wave + 5'd1;
                    end
                    else begin
                        wave <= wave - 5'd1;
                    end
                end
                default: begin
                    // Default safety assignment (should not occur)
                    state <= INCREASE;
                    wave  <= MIN_WAVE;
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------

Key corrections and improvements:

1. Defined parameters (MAX_WAVE, MIN_WAVE) so that any future changes need to update only one place.
2. Introduced named state encodings (INCREASE and DECREASE) to enhance readability.
3. Replaced the nested if-else statements with a case statement for clearer separation of the two modes.
4. Added a default branch in the case statement as a safety net (even though it shouldnâ€™t be reached).

This version adheres to best practices and is functionally equivalent to your original intent.
