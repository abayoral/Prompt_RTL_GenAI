Below is an analysis of the original code and one way to “correct” it so that the waveform reaches and holds its extreme values for one clock cycle before its direction reverses. (Note that the original code is “legal” Verilog and will simulate; however, its behavior may not be what you intended. In the original version, when wave equals 31 the very same clock cycle the state is flipped and wave is decreased (and similarly at 0 the waveform is immediately increased). This means the peak and valley values are never held.) 

A common choice for a triangular (up‐then–down) waveform is to:
1. Increment the output until the maximum value is reached.
2. Hold the maximum value for one cycle, then change direction.
3. Decrement until the minimum value is reached.
4. Hold the minimum value for one cycle, then change direction.

One corrected version that implements this “endpoint hold” behavior is given below. (Many designers also implement this as a single “adder” driven by a sign bit; see the note below.)

module signal_generator(
    input         clk,
    input         rst_n,
    output reg [4:0] wave
);

    // state: 0 = increment (ascending); 1 = decrement (descending)
    reg state;

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            wave  <= 5'd0;
            state <= 1'b0;
        end
        else begin
            if (state == 1'b0) begin
                // In increment mode: if reached max, hold value and switch state
                if (wave == 5'd31)
                    state <= 1'b1;
                else
                    wave  <= wave + 1;
            end
            else begin
                // In decrement mode: if reached min, hold value and switch state
                if (wave == 5'd0)
                    state <= 1'b0;
                else
                    wave  <= wave - 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
──────────────────────────── end code ────────────────────────────

Explanation of the Changes:
• In the “if” branches for the endpoints (wave==31 for rising, wave==0 for falling), the code now only updates the state (direction) and does not immediately change the value of wave. This causes the maximum or minimum value to appear for one clock cycle.
• In all other cases, wave increments (if state is 0) or decrements (if state is 1).

Additional Note:
An alternative design is to compute a “delta” value that’s added every clock cycle. For example, one might do:
  wave <= wave + (state ? -1 : 1);
and then check for the endpoints to change the value of state. That style is compact and common, but care must be taken so that the endpoints are not skipped if you want them held.

This corrected module now adheres to best practices by clearly separating the reset condition, using nonblocking assignments for synchronous logic, and ensuring that the endpoints are properly handled.
