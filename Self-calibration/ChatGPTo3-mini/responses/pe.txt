Below is a corrected version of the module. The main issue is that the product (a * b) of two 32‐bit numbers produces a 64‐bit result. Since the accumulator c is only 32 bits wide and the intended operation is to accumulate modulo 2^32, it is best practice to explicitly take only the lower 32 bits of the product. This not only avoids width mismatches and potential synthesis warnings but also clearly documents the intended behavior.

A corrected version using an intermediate signal might look like this:

------------------------------------------------------------
module pe(
    input  wire        clk,   // Clock signal for synchronous operations
    input  wire        rst,   // Active-high reset signal
    input  wire [31:0] a,     // 32-bit operand input a
    input  wire [31:0] b,     // 32-bit operand input b
    output reg  [31:0] c      // 32-bit output accumulator
);

    // Intermediate product that is 64 bits wide
    wire [63:0] product;
    assign product = a * b;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            // Reset the accumulator to zero on reset
            c <= 32'd0;
        end else begin
            // Add the lower 32 bits of product to c (accumulation modulo 2^32)
            c <= c + product[31:0];
        end
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Key Corrections and Best Practices:
1. Explicitly compute the full 64‐bit multiplication into an intermediate wire.
2. Use the lower 32 bits (product[31:0]) for the accumulation so that c naturally wraps around modulo 2^32.
3. Maintain nonblocking assignments in the synchronous always block.

This version adheres to best practices and ensures that the operation is performed as intended.
