Below is an annotated version of the code with a few recommended improvements. Note that the original code was free of syntax and logical errors for its intended function. However, for best practices (especially for synthesis and simulation purposes), it is common to include an asynchronous reset to initialize the registers and avoid unknown startup conditions. Also, a few comments have been added to explain the behavior.

Below are two versions: one that is functionally equivalent to your original code and one that adds an asynchronous reset (active low) for better synthesis practice.

───────────────────────────── 
Version 1 (Original functionality, no reset):

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

    // Register to hold the previous cycle's input values
    reg [7:0] in_prev;
    // Register to hold the detection result (rising edge detected in the current cycle)
    reg [7:0] detect;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Compute positive edge detection for each bit:
        // A rising edge is detected when the previous state was 0 and the current state is 1.
        detect <= (~in_prev) & in;
        // Update the history register for use in the next cycle.
        in_prev <= in;
        // Output the detection result one clock cycle later.
        pedge <= detect;
    end

endmodule

───────────────────────────── 
Version 2 (With asynchronous reset for initialization):

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input rst_n,         // Active-low asynchronous reset
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

    // Register to hold the previous cycle's input values
    reg [7:0] in_prev;
    // Register to hold the detection result (rising edge detected in the current cycle)
    reg [7:0] detect;

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            in_prev <= 8'b0;
            detect  <= 8'b0;
            pedge   <= 8'b0;
        end else begin
            // Compute positive edge detection for each bit.
            detect <= (~in_prev) & in;
            // Update the previous state.
            in_prev <= in;
            // Delay the detection result by one clock cycle.
            pedge <= detect;
        end
    end

endmodule

Explanation:

1. In both versions the always block uses nonblocking assignments, ensuring that all right‐hand sides are evaluated using the values from the previous clock edge. This results in the output "pedge" being one clock cycle behind the detection logic computed in "detect".

2. The added asynchronous reset in Version 2 ensures that all registers start in a known state (all zeros) at power-up or when rst_n is asserted low. This extra measure is considered a best practice for most FPGA and ASIC designs.

Choose the version that best fits your design requirements.
