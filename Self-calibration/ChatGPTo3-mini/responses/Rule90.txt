Below is the corrected code. One of the main issues was that the temporary variable (named “next”) was declared inside the else block whereas in synthesizable Verilog all variables used in procedural code should be declared at the beginning of the block. In the fixed version the temporary variable (renamed “next_state” for clarity) is declared at the top of the always block. This follows best practices and avoids any syntax issues.

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    integer i;
    reg [511:0] next_state;  // Declare temporary variable at the top

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            // Cell 0: left boundary uses 0 as left neighbor, right neighbor is q[1]
            next_state[0] = 1'b0 ^ q[1];

            // Cells 1 through 510: use left neighbor q[i-1] and right neighbor q[i+1]
            for (i = 1; i < 511; i = i + 1) begin
                next_state[i] = q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
            end

            // Cell 511: right boundary uses 0 as right neighbor, left neighbor is q[510]
            next_state[511] = q[510] ^ 1'b0;

            // Update state
            q <= next_state;
        end
    end

endmodule

Explanation of Corrections:
1. The declaration of “next” was moved outside the if–else block (and renamed “next_state” for clarity) so that it adheres to Verilog’s declaration rules.
2. Each branch of the if–else now uses proper begin–end blocks.
3. All assignments and use of indices remain as originally intended.

This revised module now adheres to best practices and should be synthesizable and secure.
