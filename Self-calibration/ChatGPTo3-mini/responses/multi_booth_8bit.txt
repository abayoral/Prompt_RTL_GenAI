Below is one acceptable “fixed‐up” version. Although the original code was largely correct (and would synthesize in many tools), it had two points that can be improved:

1. It is best practice when dealing with signed multiplication (and its iterations) to declare the internal registers as signed. This lets you use the built‐in arithmetic shift operators (especially the right shift “>>>”) rather than the “{mult[15], mult[15:1]}” trick.

2. Using the shift operators (<<< and >>>) makes the code clearer and more idiomatic; it also shows that you really mean an arithmetic shift right.

The corrected module below makes these improvements while keeping the overall algorithm structure identical. (Note that you could also simply leave everything unsigned and “simulate” an arithmetic right shift via concatenation. However, declaring the numbers as signed is clearer if you intend to multiply signed quantities.)

Explanation of the changes:

• By declaring multiplier and multiplicand as signed, we can write:
  multiplier <= multiplier >>> 1;
instead of manually concatenating the MSB. (Likewise, we can use the arithmetic left shift operator <<< although for left shifts the effect is the same for signed and unsigned types.)

• The overall structure of the algorithm remains that on each cycle the Booth decision is made using the low–order bit of the multiplier together with a stored extra bit (booth_prev), the partial product (p) is updated, the multiplicand is shifted left, and the multiplier is shifted right. After 16 cycles (ctr counting from 0 to 15), rdy is asserted to indicate that the final product is available.

Any functionally equivalent corrected version that follows good Verilog style and security practices is acceptable.
