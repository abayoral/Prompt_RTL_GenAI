Below is the “corrected” version of the module along with some clarifications and recommendations. In many cases the provided code is already synthesizable and “correct” for a negative‐edge–triggered flip‐flop with a synchronous reset. However, some designers might consider one or more of the following points:

1. Comment vs. Implementation Consistency
  • The comment says “synchronous reset” – that is, the reset is only sampled on the clock edge. The code correctly uses an always block that is sensitive only to the clock (negedge), so the reset is synchronous.
  • If you intended an asynchronous reset (i.e. immediate reset without waiting for a clock edge), then reset must be added to the sensitivity list.

2. Negative Edge Triggering
  • Negative‐edge–triggered registers are less common (in many FPGA flows positive edge triggering is the norm), so double‐check that your target technology supports it as expected.

3. Style and Robustness
  • If the reset value is “magic” (i.e. 8’h34), consider making it a local parameter so that it’s more self‐documenting and easier to change.
  • Although the code is fully functional, these modifications can help with maintainability, readability, and portability.

Below is the revised version of your code that incorporates these recommendations while keeping the original functionality (using negative-edge triggering with a synchronous reset):

---------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input        clk,
    input        reset,
    input  [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    // Parameter for reset value (0x34) for clarity and ease of modification.
    localparam [7:0] RESET_VAL = 8'h34;

    // Negative edge triggered D flip-flops with synchronous reset.
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= RESET_VAL;
        else
            q <= d;
    end

endmodule
---------------------------------------------------------

If instead you want an asynchronous reset (which is a common style in some designs), you would modify the always block’s sensitivity list as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input        clk,
    input        reset,
    input  [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    localparam [7:0] RESET_VAL = 8'h34;

    // Negative edge triggered D flip-flops with asynchronous reset.
    always @(negedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= RESET_VAL;
        else
            q <= d;
    end

endmodule
---------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to choose the version that matches your system requirements. In summary, the original code was functionally correct (assuming a synchronous reset was desired), but the version above offers improved style and documentation.
