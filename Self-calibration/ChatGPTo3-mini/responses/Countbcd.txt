Below is a revised version of your module. The original design was essentially correct; however, the following improvements have been made to increase clarity and follow best practices:

• Use conditional (ternary) operators in the always block so that every register is assigned exactly once in a clear, concise way.  
• Remove the redundant “keep‐same” assignments (for example “tens <= tens;”) that are unnecessary in synchronous processes.  
• Include a brief comment explaining that the carry signals are derived from the old register values (which is why it is safe to use them in the same always block).

Below is the corrected code:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input         clk,
    input         reset,   // Synchronous active‐high reset
    output [3:1]  ena,
    output [15:0] q
);

    // Internal state for each BCD digit
    reg [3:0] ones, tens, hundreds, thousands;
    
    // Carry signals computed from the current (old) state
    // When ones rolls over, enable tens; similarly for other digits.
    wire carry1 = (ones == 4'd9);
    wire carry2 = (carry1 && (tens == 4'd9));
    wire carry3 = (carry2 && (hundreds == 4'd9));

    // Synchronous BCD counter update with active-high reset
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            ones      <= 4'd0;
            tens      <= 4'd0;
            hundreds  <= 4'd0;
            thousands <= 4'd0;
        end
        else begin
            // Increment ones digit every clock cycle
            ones <= (ones == 4'd9) ? 4'd0 : ones + 4'd1;
            
            // Increment tens digit upon ones rollover
            tens <= (carry1) ? ((tens == 4'd9) ? 4'd0 : tens + 4'd1) : tens;
            
            // Increment hundreds digit upon tens rollover (which requires ones to be 9 as well)
            hundreds <= (carry2) ? ((hundreds == 4'd9) ? 4'd0 : hundreds + 4'd1) : hundreds;
            
            // Increment thousands digit upon hundreds rollover (which requires ones and tens to be 9 too)
            thousands <= (carry3) ? ((thousands == 4'd9) ? 4'd0 : thousands + 4'd1) : thousands;
        end
    end

    // Drive the enable signals for the upper three digits:
    // ena[1]: tens digit enable when ones has rolled over.
    // ena[2]: hundreds digit enable when ones and tens are 9.
    // ena[3]: thousands digit enable when ones, tens, and hundreds are 9.
    assign ena[1] = (ones == 4'd9);
    assign ena[2] = (ones == 4'd9) && (tens == 4'd9);
    assign ena[3] = (ones == 4'd9) && (tens == 4'd9) && (hundreds == 4'd9);
    
    // Concatenate the digits to form the 16-bit output.
    assign q = {thousands, hundreds, tens, ones};

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Key changes and notes:

1. The ternary operator is used to decide whether to reset a digit or increment it. This avoids multiple conditional assignments and is a common style for counters.
2. Although the original module declared ena as [3:1] (which creates a 3-bit vector with indices 3, 2, and 1), this is preserved. Ensure that any downstream logic correctly uses these bit positions.
3. Using nonblocking assignments (<=) correctly schedules updates so that the combinational carry signals are computed from the old register values.
4. Including inline comments should help any future reviewer understand the intended behavior.

This corrected module now adheres to best practices for Verilog design and verification.
