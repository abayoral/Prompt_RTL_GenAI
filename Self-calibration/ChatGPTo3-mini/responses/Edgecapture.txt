Below is the “corrected” version of your module. The functionality of your design was already correct (it detects falling edges on a per‐bit basis and latches the corresponding bits in out_reg), so the changes are mainly cosmetic and in line with best practices. For example, you might consider more descriptive signal names (such as data_in instead of in) to avoid potential keyword issues in other environments and ensure clarity. In any case, here’s one version with improved naming and formatting:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input         clk,
    input         reset,
    input  [31:0] data_in,
    output [31:0] data_out
);

    // Internal registers.
    // data_out_reg holds the latched output.
    reg [31:0] data_out_reg;
    // data_in_prev holds the previous value of data_in.
    reg [31:0] data_in_prev;
    // falling_edge_dly holds the falling edge detection for each bit.
    reg [31:0] falling_edge_dly;

    // Synchronous logic: on each rising clock edge update registers.
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            data_out_reg   <= 32'b0;
            data_in_prev   <= data_in;  // Capture current input at reset.
            falling_edge_dly <= 32'b0;
        end else begin
            // Update the output: latch ones where a falling edge was detected in the earlier cycle.
            data_out_reg <= data_out_reg | falling_edge_dly;

            // Falling edge detection: if a bit was 1 before and now 0, mark it for latching.
            falling_edge_dly <= data_in_prev & ~data_in;

            // Update previous input register.
            data_in_prev <= data_in;
        end
    end

    // Continuous assignment for the module output.
    assign data_out = data_out_reg;

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Key points addressed with this version:
1. Renamed the ports and internal signals (e.g. data_in, data_out, data_out_reg, data_in_prev, falling_edge_dly) for clarity.
2. Maintained synchronous reset and nonblocking assignments as in your original design.
3. Added comments to improve maintainability and readability.

This version adheres to best practices for Verilog coding style and verification.
