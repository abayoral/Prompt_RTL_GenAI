Below is a cleaned‐up version of the module. Note that your original code is correct SystemVerilog that uses an indexed (or dynamic) part‐select. However, best practice is to replace the explicit multiplication (sel * 4) with a shift (sel << 2) because multiplying by a constant power of 2 is both clearer and more efficient in hardware. Also, if you are using a SystemVerilog tool (and not plain Verilog 2001), it is good style to use the SystemVerilog data type “logic” rather than the older “wire” types. One more note: be sure that sel is constrained so that (sel<<2)+3 does not exceed the maximum index (1023) of input “in.”

The corrected code is shown below:

-------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input  logic [1023:0] in,
    input  logic [7:0]    sel,
    output logic [3:0]    out
);

    // Use the dynamic part-select with a shift.
    // (sel << 2) computes the starting index (sel*4).
    // The "+: 4" syntax selects a 4-bit wide slice.
    assign out = in[(sel << 2) +: 4];

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------------------

Changes Made:
1. Replaced (sel * 4) with (sel << 2) for clarity and efficiency.
2. Changed the port declarations from the implicit net type to explicit “logic” types (a common SystemVerilog best practice).

This version adheres to best practices and is functionally equivalent to your original design.
