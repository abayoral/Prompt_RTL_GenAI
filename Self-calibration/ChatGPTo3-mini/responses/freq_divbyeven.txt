Below is a cleaned‐up version of your module. Although your original code would simulate and even synthesize correctly for NUM_DIV = 10, the following changes have been made for robustness and good coding style:

1. • A check has been added (in an initial block) to ensure at elaboration time that NUM_DIV is even. (Many tools support a generate-time or elaboration-time error.)
2. • The width of the counter has been made parameterizable rather than hard‑coded to 4 bits. This makes the design more robust for different choices of NUM_DIV.
3. • A local function “clog2” is defined so that the counter is allocated only as many bits as are needed for HALF_DIV. (This is a common Verilog idiom when making parameterized counters.)

Below is the corrected module:

---------------------------------------------------------------
module freq_diveven #(parameter NUM_DIV = 10) (
    input  clk,      // Input clock signal
    input  rst_n,    // Active-low reset
    output reg clk_div // Divided clock output (f_in/NUM_DIV)
);

    // Check that NUM_DIV is even. If not, report an error at simulation startup.
    initial begin
        if (NUM_DIV % 2 != 0) begin
            $error("ERROR: NUM_DIV (%0d) must be an even number", NUM_DIV);
            $finish;
        end
    end

    // HALF_DIV is the number of input clock cycles before toggling clk_div.
    localparam HALF_DIV = NUM_DIV / 2;
    
    // Function to calculate the ceiling of the log base-2 of a number.
    function integer clog2;
        input integer value;
        integer i;
        begin
            clog2 = 0;
            for (i = value - 1; i > 0; i = i >> 1)
                clog2 = clog2 + 1;
        end
    endfunction
    
    // Bit-width for the counter; ensures that it is wide enough to count up to HALF_DIV-1.
    localparam CNT_WIDTH = clog2(HALF_DIV);
    
    // Parameterized counter.
    reg [CNT_WIDTH-1:0] cnt;
    
    // Update logic for counter and clk_div.
    // On every rising edge of clk or falling edge of rst_n, reset or update the counter.
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            cnt     <= {CNT_WIDTH{1'b0}};
            clk_div <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            // When the counter reaches HALF_DIV - 1, reset it and toggle clk_div.
            if (cnt == (HALF_DIV - 1)) begin
                cnt     <= {CNT_WIDTH{1'b0}};
                clk_div <= ~clk_div;
            end else begin
                // Otherwise, increment the counter.
                cnt <= cnt + 1'b1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
---------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the changes:

• The "initial" block checks the evenness of NUM_DIV. If it isn’t even, $error and $finish will stop simulation.
• A local function "clog2" calculates the minimum number of bits required to count up to (HALF_DIV – 1).
• The counter is declared with a width defined by CNT_WIDTH instead of a fixed [3:0] width. This is particularly useful if NUM_DIV is changed to a different value.
• The remainder of the functionality remains the same: the clk_div output toggles every HALF_DIV input clock cycles giving an output frequency of clk/NUM_DIV.

This version adheres to best coding practices and ensures that parameterization is handled in a robust way.
