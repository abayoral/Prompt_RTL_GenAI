I reviewed the code in both modules (mod_a and top_module) and found no syntax or logical errors. The module instantiation in top_module correctly maps the ports of mod_a. 

Note that the module mod_a is currently a template with no functionality. If you plan to implement behavior, you should add the appropriate logic (or comments/instructions) inside mod_a.

Below is the same code with a few minor best-practice improvements such as including a timescale directive (if you are simulating) and more explicit port declarations (using the Verilog-2001 style). If you have no additional functionality to implement in mod_a, the following code meets the requirements:

-------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module mod_a (
    output wire out1, 
    output wire out2, 
    input  wire in1, 
    input  wire in2, 
    input  wire in3, 
    input  wire in4
);
    // Insert module functionality here.
    // For example, a simple combinational assignment could be:
    // assign out1 = in1 & in2;
    // assign out2 = in3 | in4;
    
endmodule

module top_module ( 
    input  wire a, 
    input  wire b, 
    input  wire c,
    input  wire d,
    output wire out1,
    output wire out2
);

    // Instance of mod_a
    mod_a u_mod_a (
        .out1(out1), 
        .out2(out2), 
        .in1(a), 
        .in2(b), 
        .in3(c), 
        .in4(d)
    );

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------

This version is functionally equivalent to your original code and adheres to best practices regarding readability and explicit declarations. If mod_a is to be reused or extended later, you may consider adding parameterization or additional comments to clarify its intended functionality.
