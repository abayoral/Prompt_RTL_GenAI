The code you provided is functionally correct and synthesizes as intended. Both the continuous assignment (using assign) and the procedural always block implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects b when both sel_b1 and sel_b2 are true and a otherwise.

That said, here are a few minor style and best‐practice enhancements you can consider:

1. Explicitly declare signal types for clarity (e.g., using input wire instead of just input).
2. Adding a reset or default assignment in your always block is common practice for sequential logic, but since this is purely combinational (always @*), it’s already complete.
3. Although the code is logically correct, you might want to comment inline or adopt a consistent coding style if your project/bank has specific guidelines.

Below is your corrected and slightly refined version:

------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire sel_b1,
    input wire sel_b2,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always
);
    // 2-to-1 mux using continuous assignment:
    // If both sel_b1 and sel_b2 are high then select b; otherwise select a.
    assign out_assign = (sel_b1 && sel_b2) ? b : a;
    
    // 2-to-1 mux using a procedural if statement.
    always @* begin
        if (sel_b1 && sel_b2)
            out_always = b;
        else
            out_always = a;
    end
endmodule
------------------------------------------------

There were no errors in your original code—it just needed some minor stylistic improvements.
