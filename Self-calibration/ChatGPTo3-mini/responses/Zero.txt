The provided Verilog module is technically correct and functions exactly as intended. The output "zero" is implicitly a wire by default, and the assignment "assign zero = 1'b0;" correctly sets it to logic 0.

For clarity and to explicitly follow best practices, you might consider specifying the data type for the output port. Below is the revised module with an explicit declaration:

------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    output wire zero
);
    assign zero = 1'b0;
endmodule
------------------------------------------------

This version explicitly declares "zero" as a wire, although your original code works perfectly as written.
