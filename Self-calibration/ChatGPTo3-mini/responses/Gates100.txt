The provided Verilog code is already correct and synthesizes as intended. It correctly implements 100-input AND, OR, and XOR gates using reduction operators. However, I’ll provide a slightly enhanced version by adding a timescale directive and parameterizing the width for clarity and flexibility. This version follows best practices, though the original code is functionally correct.

Here’s an improved version:

--------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns/1ps
module top_module #(
    parameter WIDTH = 100
)(
    input  [WIDTH-1:0] in,
    output             out_and,
    output             out_or,
    output             out_xor
);

    // WIDTH-input AND gate
    assign out_and = &in;

    // WIDTH-input OR gate
    assign out_or  = |in;

    // WIDTH-input XOR gate (reduction XOR)
    assign out_xor = ^in;

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Notes:
1. The original code correctly used the reduction operators (&, |, ^) on the input vector.
2. The parameterized version adds flexibility and includes a timescale directive which can be useful for simulation.

Both versions are correct; you can choose the one that best meets your project’s coding standards.
