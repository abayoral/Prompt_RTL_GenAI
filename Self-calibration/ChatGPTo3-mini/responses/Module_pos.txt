Below is one acceptable corrected version. In the original code nothing is technically “wrong” (the ordering of ports is as intended), but best practices favor named port connections rather than positional connections. Using named connections makes the code easier to maintain and less prone to errors if the module definition ever changes. In the following version the instantiation of mod_a uses named port mapping:

----------------------------------------------------
module top_module ( 
    input  wire a, 
    input  wire b, 
    input  wire c,
    input  wire d,
    output wire out1,
    output wire out2
);

  // Instantiate mod_a using named port mapping.
  // Assuming mod_a’s port names are: out1, out2, a, b, c, d.
  mod_a u_mod_a ( 
      .out1(out1), 
      .out2(out2), 
      .a(a), 
      .b(b), 
      .c(c), 
      .d(d)
  );

endmodule
----------------------------------------------------

Key corrections and improvements:
1. Use of named port connections instead of the positional connection.
2. Declaring signal types (wire) explicitly for clarity (even though this is optional for top‐level ports in Verilog).

This version adheres to best practices and is more secure in the sense that any change in mod_a’s port order won’t break the connectivity.
