Below is a revised version of the code that corrects the errors. The main issues in the original were:

1. The module declaration for mod_a used only port directions (output, input, etc.) without naming the ports. In Verilog, each port must have a name so that the instantiation can connect signals properly.
2. Although the instantiation in top_module uses positional port mapping (which works if the port ordering is correct), it’s generally best practice to use named port connections to avoid mistakes. In this example, we’ll keep the positional mapping for clarity but provide the correct port names in mod_a.
3. The mod_a module did not contain any implementation. For demonstration purposes, simple assignments have been added so the module is functional.

Below is the corrected and self-contained Verilog code:

------------------------------------------------------------
module mod_a (
    output out1,
    output out2,
    input  a,
    input  b,
    input  c,
    input  d
);
    // Example implementation for mod_a:
    // For instance, out1 is the AND of a and b, and out2 is the OR of c and d.
    assign out1 = a & b;
    assign out2 = c | d;
endmodule

module top_module ( 
    input  a, 
    input  b, 
    input  c,
    input  d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);
    // Instantiate mod_a with ports connected by position:
    // out1, out2, a, b, c, d respectively.
    mod_a mod_a_instance (out1, out2, a, b, c, d);
endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Best practices note:
• Although positional port mapping is used here (with the assumption that the order in the instantiation matches the module declaration), you might consider using named port mapping:
  
      mod_a mod_a_instance (
         .out1(out1),
         .out2(out2),
         .a(a),
         .b(b),
         .c(c),
         .d(d)
      );
  
This reduces errors if the port order in mod_a ever changes.
