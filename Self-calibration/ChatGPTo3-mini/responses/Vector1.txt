The provided code is correct and functions as intended. It cleanly splits the 16‐bit input into an 8‐bit upper byte (bits 15:8) and an 8‐bit lower byte (bits 7:0). There are no syntax or logical issues. 

That said, here are a few optional best-practice tips:
• Although using "in" as an identifier is valid, you might want to choose a more descriptive name (e.g., data_in) to avoid potential confusion.
• Since the module is purely combinational, no clock or reset is required, which is fine.
• Your commenting and use of `default_nettype none` are good practices that help prevent subtle bugs.

Below is an optional revised version incorporating a slightly more descriptive name for the input:

---------------------------------------------------------
`default_nettype none
module top_module( 
    input  wire [15:0] data_in,
    output wire [7:0]  out_hi,
    output wire [7:0]  out_lo 
);

    // Extract the upper byte (bits 15:8) of the input word
    assign out_hi = data_in[15:8];

    // Extract the lower byte (bits 7:0) of the input word
    assign out_lo = data_in[7:0];

endmodule
---------------------------------------------------------

Both the original and the revised version are correct and follow best practices.
