The provided code is already syntactically and functionally correct. It cleanly splits a 16‐bit input into two 8‐bit outputs, with the lower 8 bits (bits 7 down to 0) assigned to out_lo and the upper 8 bits (bits 15 down to 8) assigned to out_hi.

However, for best practices and clarity, you might consider the following minor adjustments:

1. Consistent formatting (indenting and spacing) for improved readability.
2. Optionally, you can rename the module or ports if needed to better reflect their purpose in a larger design.
3. Add end-of-line comments next to the assign statements to clarify which bits are being assigned, though your current comments already explain this well.

Below is the slightly reformatted version that follows best practices:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  wire [15:0] in,
    output wire [7:0]  out_hi,
    output wire [7:0]  out_lo
);

    // Split the 16-bit input signal into two 8-bit signals.
    // out_lo receives the lower byte (bits 7:0)
    assign out_lo = in[7:0];
    // out_hi receives the upper byte (bits 15:8)
    assign out_hi = in[15:8];

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

There were no critical errors in your original code, so this version is essentially equivalent while adhering to good formatting practices.
