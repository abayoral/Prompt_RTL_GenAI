The provided code is correct and synthesizable. It implements an 8‐bit register with an asynchronous active‐high reset properly. No syntax, logical, or functional errors were found.

For clarity and best practices, you might consider adding a timescale directive if this module is intended for simulation. Here’s the same module with an optional timescale directive:

-------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input areset,   // active high asynchronous reset
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset)
            q <= 8'b0;
        else
            q <= d;
    end

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------

If you have a specific synthesis or style guideline to adhere to, adjustments (such as using nonblocking assignments or resets) may be required, but the given code already follows best practices for an asynchronous reset design.
