The provided code implements a simple D flip-flop with an active-high asynchronous reset and appears both syntactically and logically correct. There aren’t any issues with the sensitivity list, reset condition, or the use of nonblocking assignments (<='s). 

For clarity and best practices, you might consider explicitly declaring the direction of all ports (as shown below with "wire" for inputs), although many tools infer this automatically. Here is a version with minor stylistic improvements:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input  wire       clk,
    input  wire       areset,  // active high asynchronous reset
    input  wire [7:0] d,
    output reg  [7:0] q
);

    // Always block with asynchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset)
            q <= 8'b0000_0000;  // reset q to zero when asynchronous reset is high
        else
            q <= d;
    end

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Key Points:
• The always block has both clk and areset in its sensitivity list since the reset is asynchronous.
• The nonblocking assignment (<=) is used inside the always block, which helps prevent race conditions.
• Clearing q with 8'b0000_0000 is equivalent to using 8'b0.

Overall, your initial code was correct, and the above version is provided only to illustrate some common stylistic best practices.
