After reviewing the provided Verilog code, let's identify and correct the following issues:

1. The `out_or_logical` assignment is already correct, assuming it is intended to be a single bit representing the logical OR of the vectors `a` and `b`.
2. The `out_not` vector should be able to hold the bitwise NOT of both `a` and `b`, and it correctly alternates inversions in a 6-bit vector as stated. However, the naming of signals and usage might lead to potential confusion. 
3. Ensure best practices by clarifying comments and potentially rethinking the design for clarity if the intent was to store in a different configuration.

The provided code is not functionally incorrect given the stated operations, but let's refine the presentation and comments for clarity:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [2:0] a,
    input [2:0] b,
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
    output out_or_logical,
    output [5:0] out_not
);

// Compute the bitwise OR of the two vectors (element-wise OR)
assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;

// Compute the logical OR of the two vectors
// This gives a single-bit result true if any bit of a or b is set
assign out_or_logical = |a || |b;

// Compute the bitwise NOT for each vector separately and concatenate results
// The 6-bit output `out_not` has the NOT of vector `b` followed by the NOT of vector `a`
assign out_not = {~b, ~a};

endmodule
```

The code is clearer due to refined comments explaining the reasons behind each assignment. The logic for `out_not` has been simplified using concatenation with braces to make it more readable and to adhere to best syntactical practices.
