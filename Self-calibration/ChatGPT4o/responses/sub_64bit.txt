The provided Verilog code for `sub_64bit` has the correct logic for signed subtraction and overflow detection. However, there are certain improvements and clarifications needed to adhere to best practices:

1. **Port Declaration**: Instead of using `output reg`, it's better to declare outputs as `output` and use a separate register within an always block if needed. This is a style preference but can help in adhering to certain coding guidelines or tool requirements.

2. **Logic Consistency**: It's convenient to use `wire` type by default for `output` declarations when the output values are combinational.

Here's the updated version of the code with these considerations:

```verilog
module sub_64bit(
    input signed [63:0] A,
    input signed [63:0] B,
    output signed [63:0] result,
    output overflow
);

    // Internal regs to store outputs
    reg overflow_reg;
    reg signed [63:0] result_reg;

    always @(*) begin
        // Perform the 64-bit subtraction
        result_reg = A - B;
        
        // Check for overflow conditions
        // Overflow occurs if:
        // 1. A is positive, B is negative, and result is negative (positive overflow)
        // 2. A is negative, B is positive, and result is positive (negative overflow)
        
        if ((A[63] == 0 && B[63] == 1 && result_reg[63] == 1) || 
            (A[63] == 1 && B[63] == 0 && result_reg[63] == 0)) begin
            overflow_reg = 1;
        end else begin
            overflow_reg = 0;
        end
    end

    // Assign the register values to outputs
    assign result = result_reg;
    assign overflow = overflow_reg;

endmodule
```

### Key Points:
- **Result and Overflow Register**: The result of the subtraction and overflow are stored in internal registers (`result_reg` and `overflow_reg`). These register values are then assigned to the module's outputs using `assign` statements.
- **Combinational Logic**: All logic inside the always block remains combinational by using the `@(*)` sensitivity list. This ensures any change in inputs A or B instantly reflects in the output.
- **Overflow Logic**: Implementing overflow logic ensures that it captures any overflow conditions during subtraction, which is crucial for signed arithmetic operations.

These changes do not alter the functionality but align the module more closely with typical style and organization practices, including clean separation of combinational logic from output assignments.
