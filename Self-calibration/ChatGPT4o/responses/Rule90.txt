The provided Verilog code has a few issues that need correction:

1. The assignment to `q[0]` and `q[511]` references indices `q[-1]` and `q[512]`, which are out of bounds and commented to assume 0. However, it's better to handle these edge cases explicitly without incorrect indexing.

2. The `for` loop initialization type for `int` is not supported in Verilog-2001. Instead, use `integer`.

Here is the corrected version of the Verilog module:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            // Handle boundary conditions explicitly
            q[0] <= q[1];       // Assume q[-1] is 0; thus, q[0] = 0 ^ q[1] = q[1]
            q[511] <= q[510];   // Assume q[512] is 0; thus, q[511] = q[510] ^ 0 = q[510]
            integer i;
            for (i = 1; i < 511; i = i + 1) begin
                q[i] <= q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

Changes made:
- Replaced `int` with `integer` for loop control variable.
- Handled edge indices by explicitly assigning `q[0]` and `q[511]` considering the assumed boundary values.
- Retained the overall functional behavior, accounting for better readability and explicit assumptions.
