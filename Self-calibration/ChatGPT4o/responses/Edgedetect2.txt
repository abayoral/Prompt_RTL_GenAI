The provided Verilog code appears to have some logical errors in the way it handles edge detection. The logic `(prev_in & ~in)` is intended to detect falling edges but based on the naming of the output `anyedge`, it should detect any edge (either rising or falling). Here's how you can correct the module:

1. Detect both rising and falling edges, resulting in a change (XOR operation) between `prev_in` and `in`.
2. Ensure `prev_in` is initialized properly to avoid any unknown states.

Here is the corrected version of the Verilog module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

    reg [7:0] prev_in;

    // Initialize prev_in to zero on reset to avoid undefined behavior.
    initial begin
        prev_in = 8'b0;
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // XOR operation to detect any change between prev_in and in
        anyedge <= prev_in ^ in;
        prev_in <= in;
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes:
- Used `prev_in ^ in` to detect any change (rising or falling edge) going from `prev_in` to `in`, which is more fitting for the `anyedge` output name.
- Initialized `prev_in` to zero in an `initial` block to prevent it from carrying an unintended or unknown initial state.

These changes ensure that any edge is correctly detected, and that the initial value of `prev_in` is well-defined.
