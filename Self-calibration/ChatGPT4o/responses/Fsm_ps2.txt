The provided Verilog code for a state machine has a few issues and areas for improvement. Here is a corrected and improved version of the code:

### Issues Identified:
1. **Use of `typedef`:** The `typedef` syntax provided is incorrect for Verilog. This syntax is more appropriate in SystemVerilog.
2. **Signal `done` assignment:** Done signal assignment is synchronous, but it might be necessary to consider reset in its logic if required by your design requirements.
3. **State Variable Initialization:** It's generally good practice to initialize state variables, though not strictly necessary if initialization is correctly handled by reset.

Below is the corrected and improved version:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] in,
    input wire reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output reg done
);

    // State encoding using define instead of typedef for compatibility with Verilog
    localparam WAIT_FOR_START  = 2'b00,
               BYTE_1_RECEIVED = 2'b01,
               BYTE_2_RECEIVED = 2'b10,
               BYTE_3_RECEIVED = 2'b11;

    reg [1:0] current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic (combinational)
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            WAIT_FOR_START: begin
                if (in[3]) 
                    next_state = BYTE_1_RECEIVED;
                else 
                    next_state = WAIT_FOR_START;
            end

            BYTE_1_RECEIVED: begin
                next_state = BYTE_2_RECEIVED;
            end

            BYTE_2_RECEIVED: begin
                next_state = BYTE_3_RECEIVED;
            end

            BYTE_3_RECEIVED: begin
                if (in[3])
                    next_state = BYTE_1_RECEIVED;
                else
                    next_state = WAIT_FOR_START;
            end

            default: next_state = WAIT_FOR_START;
        endcase
    end

    // State flip-flops (sequential)
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) 
            current_state <= WAIT_FOR_START;
        else 
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // Output logic - synchronous to clk but consider reset effect if necessary
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            done <= 1'b0;
        else
            done <= (current_state == BYTE_3_RECEIVED);
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes and Explanations:
1. **State Encoding:** Used `localparam` to define state constants for clarity and maintainability.
2. **Reset Logic:** Added a reset condition to the `done` signal assignment to ensure `done` is cleared upon reset.
3. **Signal Type Clarification:** Added the `wire` keyword to input signals for clarity, although it's functionally the same in Verilog.
4. **Best Practices:** Initialized the `done` signal to `0` on reset, which is a good practice to avoid latching old values post-reset.
