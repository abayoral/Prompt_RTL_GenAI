The provided Verilog module is generally correct in terms of syntax and functionality, though there are a few improvements and considerations that can be made:

1. **Output Declaration**: For binary outputs, it's a good practice to declare them as single-bit ([0:0]) to make it explicitly clear that they are 1-bit wide.
2. **Redundancy in Conditional Statements**: The usage of a ternary operator to assign 1-bit outputs for boolean conditions is redundant. Logical expressions naturally evaluate to a 1-bit value.

Here's the corrected and improved version of the Verilog code:

```verilog
module comparator_3bit (
    input [2:0] A, 
    input [2:0] B,
    output wire A_greater, 
    output wire A_equal, 
    output wire A_less
);

    // Combinational logic for 3-bit comparator
    assign A_greater = (A > B);
    assign A_equal   = (A == B);
    assign A_less    = (A < B);

endmodule
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Output `wire`**: Given that the outputs will be driven by combinational logic, explicitly declaring them as `wire` is good practice, although simply declaring them as `output` would automatically make them wires.
- **Efficient Code**: Removing unnecessary ternary operators results in cleaner and more efficient code, while maintaining clarity.
