The given Verilog code attempts to create a top module with two registers, `q_pos` and `q_neg`, to store the data `d` on the rising and falling edges of the clock `clk`, respectively. However, there is a logical error in the way the output `q` is assigned based on the clock `clk`. The current module can potentially produce unintended behavior because the `q` assignment logic suggests that if the clock is high, it should output `q_neg`, and if low, it should output `q_pos`. This is a reverse of the expected behavior since `q_pos` holds data from the positive edge while `q_neg` holds data from the negative edge.

Here is the corrected version:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) begin
        if (clk)
            q <= q_pos;
        else
            q <= q_neg;
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes and Explanations:
1. **Output Declaration**: The output `q` is declared as `reg` since it is driven from an `always` block.
2. **Logical Correction**: The logic for determining when to assign `q_pos` or `q_neg` to `q` has been fixed:
   - A single `always` block with sensitivity to both positive and negative clock edges is used.
   - During the rising edge, `q` is assigned `q_pos`, while during the falling edge, it is assigned `q_neg`.
3. **Same Control Block**: Previously, the assignment to `q` was dependent on the clock level at that instant, which does not accurately reflect the registered behavior. The change ensures the proper behavior of storing and then showing the registered data on the same respective clock edge condition. This helps avoid metastability issues and ensures that the output behaves in a predictable manner.

This restructuring should provide a functionally correct double-edge-triggered D flip-flop behavior for storing and outputting data properly.
