The provided Verilog code aims to determine the position of the highest set bit (from least significant to most significant) in a 4-bit input. However, there are logical issues in the `casez` statement priority and some incorrect assumptions in the intended bit prioritization.

Here's a corrected version of the module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [3:0] in,
    output reg [1:0] pos
);

    always @(*) begin
        casez (in)
            4'b1000: pos = 2'b11; // Highest priority to the most significant bit
            4'b0100: pos = 2'b10;
            4'b0010: pos = 2'b01;
            4'b0001: pos = 2'b00; // Lowest priority to the least significant bit
            default: pos = 2'b00; // If no bits are set, output is zero
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Changes made:
1. **Correcting Priority**: The priority should be from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB), meaning if multiple bits are set, the value of `pos` should correspond to the most significant set bit, not the least significant as was the case before.

2. **Case Statement Order**: Rearranged the `casez` statements in the `always` block to check the most significant bits first, which respects the prioritization described above.

3. **Default Case**: The comment for the default case is updated to clarify that this will be the output if no bits are set in `in`, which is indeed a valid scenario.

This code now effectively prioritizes the more significant bits if they are set, conforming to conventional priority encoding.
