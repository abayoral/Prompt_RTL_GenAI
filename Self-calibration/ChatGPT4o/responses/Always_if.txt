The provided Verilog module appears mostly correct, but there are a couple of stylistic improvements and best practice recommendations that can be applied:

1. Ensure that ports and signals are declared in a clear and consistent manner.
2. Use `wire` explicitly for clarity, even though it is not strictly necessary for port outputs.
3. Make sure to use consistent naming conventions for inputs and outputs.
4. Protect against latches in case of more complex conditions, though in this case, your procedural block should be fine.

Here is the revised version of the code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,         // Declare explicitly as wire for better readability
    input wire b,         // Declare explicitly as wire for better readability
    input wire sel_b1,    // Declare explicitly as wire for better readability
    input wire sel_b2,    // Declare explicitly as wire for better readability
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always
);

    // Using assign statement
    assign out_assign = (sel_b1 && sel_b2) ? b : a;

    // Using procedural if statement
    always @(*) begin
        if (sel_b1 && sel_b2) begin
            out_always = b;
        end else begin
            out_always = a;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

Key points to note:
- Wires don't need explicit declaration in module ports (`input` and `output`), but declaring them as `input wire` or `output wire` is a best practice for clarity.
- The procedural block will not infer any unintended latch as it covers both the true and false conditions of the `if` statement.
- Comments were added for consistency and to maintain readability.
