The provided Verilog code for a pulse detection module has a few logical and structural aspects that could be improved for better functionality and practice. Let's analyze it:

1. **State Encoding and Initialization**: The `typedef` used for state encoding is correct and enhances readability, but it should be better introduced outside the `always` block to avoid redundancy issues across synthesis or simulation tool incompatibilities.

2. **State Transition and Output Logic**: The logic does not account for a reset scenario within the combinational block. Also, the `data_out` handling can be simplified by managing it in the state transition block.

3. **`default` State Handling**: The `default` case in the combinational logic should ideally transition to a safe state or introduce assertions for unreachable code for better design robustness.

4. **Best Practices**: It's typically advisable to use blocking assignments (`=`) in combinational always blocks and non-blocking assignments (`<=`) in sequential ones to prevent unwanted latches.

Here is a corrected version of the module:

```verilog
module pulse_detect (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire data_in,
    output reg data_out
);

    // Define state encoding for three states
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        IDLE        = 2'b00,
        DETECT_ONE  = 2'b01,
        DETECT_ZERO = 2'b10
    } state_t;

    // State register to hold the state
    reg state_t state, state_next;

    // Sequential logic: State transition on clock edge or reset
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            state <= IDLE;
            data_out <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            state <= state_next;
            // Move the output logic to only look at state transitions
            case (state_next)
                DETECT_ZERO: data_out <= 1'b1;
                default: data_out <= 1'b0;
            endcase
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic: Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (data_in == 1'b1)
                    state_next = DETECT_ONE;
                else
                    state_next = IDLE;
            end
            DETECT_ONE: begin
                if (data_in == 1'b0)
                    state_next = DETECT_ZERO;
                else
                    state_next = DETECT_ONE;
            end
            DETECT_ZERO: begin
                if (data_in == 1'b0)
                    state_next = IDLE;
                else
                    state_next = DETECT_ONE;
            end
            default: state_next = IDLE;  // Optional: Add assert here for safety
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of Corrections:

- The handling for `state_next` uses blocking assignments, which is appropriate for combinational logic.
- The `data_out` signal logic is moved inside the sequential block to emphasize state-based transitions and simplify the reset mechanism.
- Consistency in using state machines is maintained with more defined transitions.
- The `typedef enum logic` is correctly using a `state_t` type, keeping the state handling neat.
  
This code now reflects better practices for Verilog design and should function as intended for pulse detection.
