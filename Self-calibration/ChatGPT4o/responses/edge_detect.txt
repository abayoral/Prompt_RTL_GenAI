The provided Verilog code defines an edge detection module, which detects both rising and falling edges of signal `a`. Reviewing the code, there are no obvious syntax errors, but there are a couple of areas that can be optimized for better clarity and adherence to conventions. Let's go through the code and highlight any improvements or necessary corrections:

1. **Signal Naming**: The output signal `down` might be more conventionally named `fall` to clearly indicate its purpose of detecting a falling edge.

2. **Reset Values**: The reset should explicitly use `1'b0` for clarity in setting binary values when resetting signals.

Here is the corrected and optimized code:

```verilog
module edge_detect(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire a,
    output reg rise,
    output reg fall     // Changed 'down' to 'fall' for clarity
);

    // Register to hold the previous state of 'a'
    reg a_prev;

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            // Reset all outputs and internal state
            rise <= 1'b0;
            fall <= 1'b0;  // Ensure all uses of binary values are consistent
            a_prev <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            // Detect rising edge: current 'a' is 1, previous 'a' was 0
            rise <= (a && !a_prev);

            // Detect falling edge: current 'a' is 0, previous 'a' was 1
            fall <= (!a && a_prev);

            // Update the previous state of 'a' for the next cycle
            a_prev <= a;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

Changes made:
- Renamed `down` to `fall` to make the function of the signal more intuitive.
- Standardized the reset values to use `1'b0` to make it explicit that the values are binary.

These improvements will enhance the readability and maintainability of the module while ensuring that its functionality remains correct.
