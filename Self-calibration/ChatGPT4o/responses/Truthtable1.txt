The provided Verilog module implements a sum-of-products logic function with three inputs and one output. After reviewing the code, I found that the logic appears correct with respect to the implied truth table. However, for completeness and to adhere to best practices, let me also address some considerations:

1. **Port Comments**: Ensure consistency in commenting for clarity.
2. **Code Readability**: Keep the logical expressions on their own lines for easy readability.

Here's the revised Verilog code:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input x3,   // input signal x3
    input x2,   // input signal x2
    input x1,   // input signal x1
    output f    // output signal f
);

    // Sum-of-products logic implementation
    assign f = (~x3 & x2 & ~x1) |  // Match for when x3=0, x2=1, x1=0
               (~x3 & x2 & x1)  |  // Match for when x3=0, x2=1, x1=1
               (x3 & ~x2 & x1)  |  // Match for when x3=1, x2=0, x1=1
               (x3 & x2 & x1);     // Match for when x3=1, x2=1, x1=1

endmodule
```

This version maintains the original logic and improves readability without changing functionality. Ensure this logic is what you intended based on the described truth table for the output `f`. If it does not meet the desired truth table, further adjustments would be required on the sum-of-products terms.
