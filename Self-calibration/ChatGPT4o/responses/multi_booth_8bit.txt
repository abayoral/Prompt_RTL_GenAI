The provided Verilog code implements an 8-bit Booth's multiplier. There are several issues present in the code that need correction:

1. **Order of Reset Logic**: The assignment to `multiplier` and `multiplicand` in the reset block incorrectly concatenates 17 bits for `multiplier` and not 16 bits. Also, it includes `1'b0`, which is not necessary.
2. **Counter function**: The counter should properly compare with 8 (not 16) as we are operating on 8-bit inputs and bits have been extended to 16 due to multiplicand multiplication.
3. **Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR) Logic**: The `multiplier` should incorporate correct logic for arithmetic shift right.
4. **Multipliers edge cases**: The multiplier should cater for cases where 2's complement representation reaches extremes.
5. **Booth's Algorithm Completion**: Once complete, the circuit should hold `p` steady.

Here is the corrected version with annotations:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire [7:0] a,
    input wire [7:0] b,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);

    reg [15:0] multiplier;
    reg [15:0] multiplicand;
    reg [3:0] ctr; // Updated to 4 bits - max count is 8.

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Extend the inputs to 16 bits for signed operations
            multiplier <= {{8{a[7]}}, a}; // Corrected concatenation
            multiplicand <= {{8{b[7]}}, b}; 
            ctr <= 4'b0; // Updated to 4 bits
            p <= 16'b0;
            rdy <= 1'b0;
        end else if (ctr < 8) begin // Operation on 8 steps
            case ({multiplier[1:0]})
                2'b01: p <= p + multiplicand;
                2'b10: p <= p - multiplicand;
                default: ; // No operation for other cases
            endcase
            
            // Arithmetic shift right on the multiplier
            multiplier <= {multiplier[15], multiplier[15:1]};
            
            ctr <= ctr + 1;
        end else begin
            rdy <= 1'b1; // Signal that multiplication is complete
        end
    end

endmodule
```

**Corrections made:**
- Fixed bit extension for `multiplier`.
- Adjusted counter for 8-bit operation.
- Corrected arithmetic right shift and updating process for `multiplier`.
- Ensured the computation completes correctly with a ready signal and maintains the result stable.
