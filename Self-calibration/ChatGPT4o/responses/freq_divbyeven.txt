The given Verilog module `freq_diveven` contains several issues that need addressing for correctness and better practices. Let's review these:

1. **Counter Width**: The counter width should be sufficient to hold `NUM_DIV/2`, which is determined by computing the number of bits required for `NUM_DIV/2`. 

2. **Initial Block for Parameter Checking**: Using an initial block for parameter checking won't synthesize as expected in most FPGA/ASIC workflows because initial blocks are typically ignored in synthesis. Proper parameter validation should be done in the testbench.

3. **Reset Signal Naming**: While `rst_n` is a common convention for active low reset, always ensure it's implemented consistently without ambiguity.

4. **Logical Correctness**: Ensure that the toggling logic of the divided clock is correct according to the division requirements.

Hereâ€™s an improved version of the module:

```verilog
module freq_diveven #(parameter NUM_DIV = 4) (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    output reg clk_div
);

    // Calculate the number of bits needed for the counter
    localparam CNT_WIDTH = $clog2(NUM_DIV/2);

    // Counter to track the number of clock cycles
    reg [CNT_WIDTH-1:0] cnt;

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            cnt <= 0;
            clk_div <= 0;
        end else begin
            if (cnt < (NUM_DIV/2) - 1) begin
                cnt <= cnt + 1'b1;
            end else begin
                cnt <= 0;
                clk_div <= ~clk_div;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Corrections and Improvements:
1. **Counter Width Calculation**: Introduced `localparam CNT_WIDTH = $clog2(NUM_DIV/2);` to calculate the required width of the counter. This ensures the design adapts appropriately to the parameter value.

2. **Removed Initial Block**: The `initial` block for parameter checking was removed because it is inappropriate for a synthesizable design. Such checks should be handled in the testbench or design constraints.

3. **Robust Reset and Counter Logic**: The module resets all counters and output correctly ensuring predictable startup conditions.

4. **General Code Cleanup**: Ensured the module logic and structure are clear and concise adhering to best practices.

These modifications make the design more robust and synthesize correctly, adhering to standard design conventions.
