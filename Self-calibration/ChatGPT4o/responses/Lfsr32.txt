Upon reviewing the provided Verilog code, the logic appears to describe a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with a synchronous reset. However, the feedback taps used here (`q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0]`) may not constitute a proper maximal length polynomial for a 32-bit LFSR. However, I'll focus only on the syntax and structure of the code as you did not provide a specific polynomial for the LFSR or indicate it must be maximal. There are no syntactical errors, but I will improve the code with best practices.

Here's the revised code:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,    // Active-high synchronous reset to 32'h1
    output reg [31:0] q
); 

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 32'h1; // Initialize the LFSR to 1 on reset
        end else begin
            q <= {q[30:0], q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0]};
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Improvements Made:
1. **Explicit Signal Types**: Added `wire` to the `clk` and `reset` input declarations to explicitly define the signal type, even though it's optional for inputs.
2. **Comment Clarity**: Provided comments are retained and concise, explaining the reset behavior.
3. **No Functional Errors**: The logic synthesizes an LFSR, assuming taps are intended as given.

### Additional Notes:
- If you require specific LFSR characteristics like a maximal-length sequence, you might need to verify the polynomial taps used. Typically, this would mean verifying against known good polynomials for 32-bit LFSRs.
- The reset value `32'h1` effectively seeds this LFSR, but ensure it's suitable for your application context.
