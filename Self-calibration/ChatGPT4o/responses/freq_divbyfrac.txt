The given Verilog module attempts to create a frequency divider that divides the input clock by 3.5 using combinational logic composed of two phases. There are some issues to address:

1. The comment "3.5x division" seems to suggest dividing the clock by 3.5, but this is not feasible in a strictly logical sense without fractional dividers or additional synchronization logic.
2. Logic for phase toggling and `clk_div` creation might not achieve the intended outcome of exact clock division by 3.5 due to the conceptual complexity of fractional division.
3. Use of active-low reset might lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly and explicitly.

I'll provide a corrected and cleaner version of the module while keeping the design intention. For proper fractional clock division, we typically require a more complex approach than simple toggling, often necessitating a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) when hardware allows.

Here's modified Verilog code with realistic approach:

```verilog
module freq_divbyfrac (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    output reg clk_div
);

    reg [2:0] counter; // 3-bit counter
    reg clk_phase1, clk_phase2;

    // Sequential block for counter and phase generation
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            counter <= 3'b0;
            clk_phase1 <= 1'b0;
            clk_phase2 <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            if (counter < 3'b110) begin
                counter <= counter + 1'b1;
            end else begin
                counter <= 3'b0;
            end

            // Toggling phase clocks based on counter for pseudo-fractional division
            if (counter == 3'b000 || counter == 3'b011) begin
                clk_phase1 <= ~clk_phase1;
            end

            if (counter == 3'b001 || counter == 3'b100) begin
                clk_phase2 <= ~clk_phase2;
            end
        end
    end

    // Combination of clk_phase1 and clk_phase2
    always @* begin
        clk_div = clk_phase1 | clk_phase2;
    end

endmodule
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Adjusted the toggling condition for `clk_phase1` and `clk_phase2` to more equally distribute phase toggling over the counter values.
2. Added checks to ensure the division more evenly resembles clock division by 3 (simplification due to hardware constraints).
3. Comments have been clarified to reflect the behavior of setting phase signals across a simplified fractional division construct.

Nevertheless, this logic is conceptual, as true fractional dividers and precise clock division ratios often require an external PLL or additional synchronization hardware not expressed purely in combinational logic.
