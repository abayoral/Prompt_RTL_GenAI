Let's analyze the provided Verilog code and identify any issues:

1. **Memory Array Size Error**: The memory declaration `reg [WIDTH-1:0] ram [0:DEPTH-1];` is incorrect. Since `DEPTH` specifies the total number of locations and it should be 2^n for it to be a properly indexed RAM, but in this case, it can lead to confusion. The usage for initializing should consider whether it's indexing from `0` to `DEPTH-1`.

2. **Reset Logic**: The reset logic correctly initializes the RAM, however, it is important to note that initializing registers on a clock edge can lead to race conditions. It is common to have an asynchronous reset that initializes memory without relying on clock cycles.

3. **Memory Access**: The access to `ram[write_addr]` and `ram[read_addr]` should be further protected from out-of-bound access. Although the current implementation assumes valid addresses due to datatype constraints, it's safest to add checks if in a real-world scenario.

4. **Always Blocks**: The continuous assignment of `read_data` in the read operation should use non-blocking assignments to avoid issues associated with timing.

Here is the corrected version of the Verilog module:

```verilog
module dual_port_ram (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire write_en,
    input wire [2:0] write_addr,
    input wire [5:0] write_data,
    input wire read_en,
    input wire [2:0] read_addr,
    output reg [5:0] read_data
);
    // Parameters for RAM width and depth
    parameter WIDTH = 6;
    parameter DEPTH = 8;

    // Memory array declaration
    reg [WIDTH-1:0] ram [0:DEPTH-1];

    // Asynchronous reset for RAM initialization
    integer i;
    always @(negedge rst_n) begin
        // Reset all memory locations to zero
        for (i = 0; i < DEPTH; i = i + 1) begin
            ram[i] <= 0;
        end
    end

    // Write operation - synchronous
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (write_en) begin
            ram[write_addr] <= write_data; // Memory write
        end
    end

    // Read operation - synchronous
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (read_en) begin
            read_data <= ram[read_addr]; // Memory read
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the reset block to be asynchronous, removing `posedge clk` from it.
2. Ensured that all memory write and read operations are synchronous.
3. Emphasized the use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`) for writing to `read_data` within the clocked block to adhere to best practices.

This code maintains good structure and should provide a solid dual-port RAM functionality within a Verilog design.
