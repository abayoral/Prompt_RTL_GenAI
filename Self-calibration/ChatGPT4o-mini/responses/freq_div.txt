Upon reviewing the provided Verilog code for the frequency divider module, I've identified several issues that can lead to incorrect behavior. Below are the observations and corrections:

### Issues Identified:
1. **Counter Implementation**: The counter values used to toggle `CLK_10` and `CLK_1` are incorrect. The counters should be adjusted based on how many clock cycles are needed from the input clock to produce the desired output frequency:
   - For `CLK_10` at 10 MHz, the counter should count to 4, not 2.
   - For `CLK_1` at 1 MHz, the counter should count to 99, not 49.

2. **Resetting Registers**: The resets for the counters (`cnt_10` and `cnt_100`) should ideally happen outside the conditions checking their value. This ensures thereâ€™s no delay in resetting.

3. **Toggle Logic**: The way the clocks are currently toggled is compatible, but it can be optimized for better clarity.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected code with the adjustments made:

```verilog
module freq_div (
    input wire CLK_in,
    input wire RST,
    output reg CLK_50,
    output reg CLK_10,
    output reg CLK_1
);

reg [1:0] cnt_10;       // Counter for 10MHz
reg [6:0] cnt_100;      // Counter for 1MHz

// Toggle CLK_50 every 1 clock cycle (50MHz <- CLK_in)
always @(posedge CLK_in or posedge RST) begin
    if (RST) begin
        CLK_50 <= 0;
    end else begin
        CLK_50 <= ~CLK_50; // Toggle CLK_50 on every positive edge
    end
end

// Toggle CLK_10 every 4 clock cycles of CLK_in (10MHz)
always @(posedge CLK_in or posedge RST) begin
    if (RST) begin
        CLK_10 <= 0;
        cnt_10 <= 0;
    end else begin
        if (cnt_10 == 3) begin
            CLK_10 <= ~CLK_10; // Toggle CLK_10 for every four cycles of CLK_in
            cnt_10 <= 0;       // Reset the counter
        end else begin
            cnt_10 <= cnt_10 + 1; // Increment counter
        end
    end
end

// Toggle CLK_1 every 100 clock cycles of CLK_in (1MHz)
always @(posedge CLK_in or posedge RST) begin
    if (RST) begin
        CLK_1 <= 0;
        cnt_100 <= 0;
    end else begin
        if (cnt_100 == 99) begin
            CLK_1 <= ~CLK_1; // Toggle CLK_1 for every 100 cycles of CLK_in
            cnt_100 <= 0;    // Reset the counter
        end else begin
            cnt_100 <= cnt_100 + 1; // Increment counter
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Adjusted `cnt_10` to toggle `CLK_10` every 4 clock cycles (`cnt_10 == 3`) to achieve 10 MHz output.
- Adjusted `cnt_100` to toggle `CLK_1` every 100 clock cycles (`cnt_100 == 99`) to achieve 1 MHz output.
- Ensured that all register resets are performed properly, enhancing readability and maintaining good coding practice.

This updated code should function correctly and meet your design requirements for the specified frequencies.
