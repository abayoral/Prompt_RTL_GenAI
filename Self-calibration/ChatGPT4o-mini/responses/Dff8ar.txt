The given Verilog module has a well-defined structure and correctly implements a synchronous reset logic. However, we should ensure a few best practices are adhered to for clarity and robustness:

1. **Signal Initialization**: The output `q` should be initialized properly at the beginning of the module, although it is reset correctly in the `areset` case.

2. **Commenting**: While comments are informative, they could be made a bit more detailed to enhance code readability.

3. **Sensitivity List**: The sensitivity list is correct, as it includes both the clock and the asynchronous reset signal, but I will ensure it is listed in a style that matches modern Verilog practices (although the current style is acceptable).

With those points in mind, here is the corrected version of your code, including minor tweaks for clarity but retaining the original functionality:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input areset,   // Active high asynchronous reset
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q   // Output register
);

    // Asynchronous reset and synchronous load from d
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            q <= 8'b0; // Reset output q to 0 on active reset
        end else begin
            q <= d; // Transfer input d to output q on clock edge
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Repeatedly initializing or resetting `q` is a good practice; therefore, the comment greater clarifies its behavior in resets.
- The comments have been slightly refined to ensure they align with best practices for clarity.
