The given Verilog code has a couple of issues that need to be addressed to ensure correct functionality and best practices. Key errors include the following:

1. The use of `bit_count` in the combinational always block (`always @(*)`) is incorrect because it should be registered in a clocked always block. Using it in this context can lead to simulation issues as Verilog does not store state across iterations of an event.
  
2. The `done` signal should also be managed correctly to ensure it represents a valid state based on transitions.

3. The default state initialization is missing in configurations and can lead to undefined behavior if `current_state` is not initialized properly.

4. For defining states, using `reg` in enumeration is unconventional. We often use `logic` type instead (if supported by your synthesis tool) as it can ease multi-dimensional port handling.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of your module, addressing these issues:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output reg done
);

    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        IDLE = 3'b000,
        START_BIT = 3'b001,
        DATA_BITS = 3'b010,
        STOP_BIT = 3'b011,
        ERROR = 3'b100
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    reg [3:0] bit_count; // Counter for data bits

    // State transition logic (synchronous with reset)
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
            done <= 0;
            bit_count <= 0;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic (combinational)
    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignments
        next_state = current_state; // Hold current state by default
        done = 0; // Default done to 0
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in == 1'b0) // Start bit detected
                    next_state = START_BIT;
            end
            START_BIT: begin
                if (in == 1'b1) // End of start bit
                    next_state = DATA_BITS; // Move to data bits
            end
            DATA_BITS: begin
                if (bit_count < 8) begin
                    if (in == 1'b0 || in == 1'b1) begin // Valid data bit
                        next_state = DATA_BITS; // Remain in DATA_BITS
                    end
                end else begin
                    next_state = STOP_BIT; // Move to stop bit after receiving 8 bits
                end
            end
            STOP_BIT: begin
                if (in == 1'b1) begin // Stop bit detected
                    done = 1; // Byte successfully received
                    next_state = IDLE; // Return to idle
                end else begin
                    next_state = ERROR; // Error if stop bit is not correct
                end
            end
            ERROR: begin
                if (in == 1'b1) begin // Wait for a stop bit
                    next_state = IDLE; // Return to idle after receiving a stop bit
                end // Else, stay in ERROR 
            end
            default: begin
                next_state = IDLE; // Default case to handle any unexpected state
            end
        endcase
    end

    // Update bit_count in a synchronous process
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            bit_count <= 0;
        end else begin
            if (current_state == DATA_BITS && bit_count < 8) begin
                bit_count <= bit_count + 1; // Count data bits received
            end else if (current_state == STOP_BIT) begin
                bit_count <= 0; // Reset bit counter for next byte
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes Made:
- `typedef enum reg` was changed to `typedef enum logic` (legitimate style depending on synthesis tool).
- The bit counting logic was moved to a separate clocked process block.
- Added default assignments for `next_state` and `done` signal to handle undefined cases better.
- Structures and overall comments were aligned with clear practices for readability and maintainability.
