The given Verilog code appears to be generally correct in terms of syntax and functionality. However, there are a couple of points that can be improved to adhere to best practices and ensure that the synchronous reset operates as expected.

### Identified Points:
1. **Reset Handling**: The comments mention that the reset is "Active-high synchronous," but the typical practice is to also mention that the reset should be applied on the rising edge of the clock. If the reset is indeed active high and synchronous, it should be checked immediately in the sensitivity list of the `always` block.
2. **Comments**: The use of comments would help readers understand the functionality better.
3. **Using `default` value:** It's often a good idea to initialize outputs explicitly in case of unintended latches or X states.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input reset,    // Active-high synchronous reset to 32'h1
    output reg [31:0] q
); 

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 32'h1; // On reset, set q to 32'h1
        end else begin
            // Shift the register and apply the taps
            q <= {q[30:0], (q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0])}; // Shift operation
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
- **Synchronous Reset**: The original code already handled the reset in the clock edge block, signifying that it is synchronous. There is nothing inherently wrong here; it just needed clarification in comments.
- **Default Initialization**: In simulation, if not used, the default state of `q` would be unknown (X). Often, a reset state is a clear initialization to avoid ambiguity.
- **Comment clarity**: Enhanced comments that describe the intended behavior explicitly for every action being performed in the `always` block.

The original code was almost correct, but ensuring clarity and robustness in resets is crucial especially in FPGA or ASIC designs, where synthesis tools expect clear toggle points for clocked logic.
