The provided Verilog code contains a few logical and design-related issues. The most significant issue arises from the creation of a feedback loop using flip-flops. In this case, the output of one flip-flop feeds into the next; this can potentially lead to unwanted behavior, like creating a combinatorial loop without a clear synchronous reset condition.

To correct the design while adhering to best practices:

1. **Remove the feedback loop**: The outputs of the flip-flops should not be directly connected in such a manner. Typically, D flip-flops are used in series for shift-register purposes or specific sequential circuits, but here, they create a loop.
   
2. **Clarify functionality**: It's unclear what the intended function is since there are no additional reset or enable signals. For a simple D flip-flop chain, it's common to use an initial setup that provides clear state transitions.

3. **Introduce reset functionality (optional)**: Depending on intended use, including a reset input might be beneficial to initialize the flip-flops.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version where we simplify the example to have a clearer purpose:

```verilog
module my_dff (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end
endmodule

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output q
);
    wire q1, q2;

    // Instantiate the first D flip-flop
    my_dff dff0 (.clk(clk), .d(d), .q(q1)); // First flip-flop driven by external input d

    // Instantiate the second D flip-flop using the output of the first
    my_dff dff1 (.clk(clk), .d(q1), .q(q2)); // Second flip-flop driven by q1

    // Instantiate the third D flip-flop using the output of the second
    my_dff dff2 (.clk(clk), .d(q2), .q(q)); // Third flip-flop driven by q2

endmodule
```

**Changes Made:**
1. Maintained the structure of the flip-flop definitions but clarified the connections to avoid confusion and ensure proper operation.
2. Improved comments for clarity on what each instance of `my_dff` does.
3. This design is now less prone to issues associated with feedback loops as it effectively acts as a shift register. If needed, additional functionality like reset can be integrated based on specific requirements. 

Ensure that the actual use case for the module is understood; if behavior needs to be explicitly defined (like synchronous resets or enablers), those should be added to the `my_dff` definition accordingly.
