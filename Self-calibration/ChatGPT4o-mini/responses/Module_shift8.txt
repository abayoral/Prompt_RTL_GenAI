The provided Verilog code has a few points that need improvement or correction to adhere to best practices and ensure proper synthesis behavior:

1. **The Use of Non-Blocking Assignments**: Inside the sequential logic defined in `my_dff8`, it is good practice to use non-blocking assignments (`<=`) when writing to flip-flops, which is indeed being followed here. However, in the `top_module`, the output `q` is being assigned using blocking assignments (`=`) inside a combinational process. This may lead to unpredictable behavior.

2. **Sensitivity List**: Although the `always @(*)` block automatically generates a sensitivity list, it's essential to confirm that the logic behaves as expected. Since `q` should be directly updated based on the clock edge, it must be inside a proper clock-triggered always block.

3. **Default Case Handling**: The default case may not be necessary in your design as `sel` is a 2-bit signal, and all cases are already covered. However, it is safe to leave it in place for robustness.

Here's the corrected version of the original Verilog code:

```verilog
module my_dff8 ( 
    input clk, 
    input [7:0] d, 
    output reg [7:0] q 
);
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d; // Non-blocking assignment is correct for flip-flop behavior
    end
endmodule

module top_module ( 
    input clk, 
    input [7:0] d, 
    input [1:0] sel, 
    output reg [7:0] q 
);
    wire [7:0] q1, q2, q3;

    my_dff8 dff1 (.clk(clk), .d(d), .q(q1));
    my_dff8 dff2 (.clk(clk), .d(q1), .q(q2));
    my_dff8 dff3 (.clk(clk), .d(q2), .q(q3));

    always @(posedge clk) begin // Change to clock-triggered always block
        case(sel)
            2'b00: q <= d;     // No delay
            2'b01: q <= q1;    // 1 clock delay
            2'b10: q <= q2;    // 2 clock delay
            2'b11: q <= q3;    // 3 clock delay
            default: q <= d;   // Default case (redundant but safe)
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Changed `always @(*)` to `always @(posedge clk)` in `top_module`. This ensures that `q` is updated synchronously with the clock, matching the behavior typically expected in digital circuits that involve flip-flops.
- Replaced blocking assignments with non-blocking assignments (`<=`) for the output `q` inside the clocked process to ensure correct synthesis and simulation behavior. 

These changes adhere to the best practices of coding in Verilog, especially in synchronous design.
