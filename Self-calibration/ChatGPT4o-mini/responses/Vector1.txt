The provided Verilog code is quite straightforward and well-structured, adhering to best practices such as using `default_nettype none`. The logic of the module, which splits a 16-bit input into two 8-bit outputs (high and low bytes), is correct and does not have any syntactical or functional errors.

However, for improved readability and maintainability, we can add comments to clarify the purpose of the module and its ports. Additionally, it is a good practice to use `generate` statements when applicable to enhance modularity, but for this simple operation, that is not necessary.

Here's a slightly enhanced and documented version of your module, maintaining the same functionality:

```verilog
`default_nettype none     // Disable implicit nets. Reduces some types of bugs.

/**
 * @brief Top-level module that splits a 16-bit input into two 8-bit outputs.
 * 
 * @param in 16-bit input vector.
 * @param out_hi 8-bit output for the higher byte of 'in'.
 * @param out_lo 8-bit output for the lower byte of 'in'.
 */
module top_module( 
    input wire [15:0] in,   // 16-bit input
    output wire [7:0] out_hi, // Higher 8 bits of the input
    output wire [7:0] out_lo  // Lower 8 bits of the input
);

    // Assign upper 8 bits to out_hi
    assign out_hi = in[15:8]; 
    
    // Assign lower 8 bits to out_lo
    assign out_lo = in[7:0];  

endmodule
```

### Summary of modifications:
1. **Comments**: Enhanced comments to clarify the functionality of the module, inputs, and outputs.
2. **Documentation**: Added a module docstring that describes the purpose of the module, which is useful for anyone looking to understand the function at a glance.

These changes improve the readability and maintainability of the code without altering its initial functionality.
