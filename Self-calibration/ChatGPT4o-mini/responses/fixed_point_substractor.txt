The provided Verilog module has a few issues and can be improved for better reliability and clarity. Here are the primary concerns:

1. **Redundant Zero Check**: The checks for `res == 0` are redundant, as `c` can just be assigned `res` directly. If `res` is zero, it will be assigned correctly without needing a special case.
  
2. **Handling Overflow**: The current implementation doesn't detect overflow conditions that can occur during unsigned arithmetic. Given it's a fixed-point subtractor, we should account for potential underflow (negative result for unsigned).

3. **Use of non-blocking assignments**: For combinational logic, it's better to use non-blocking assignments (`<=`). Given that `c` is declared as a `reg`, itâ€™s appropriate to ensure proper scheduling of assignments for sensitive regions.

4. **Print Messages/Comments**: The comments about checking the result for zero are overly verbose and can be simplified.

5. **Parameterization of Bit Width**: The parameters `N` and `Q` are defined, but there's a lack of clarity on their relationship in fixed-point arithmetic usage; it would be useful to mention that `N` should be greater than `Q`.

Here is a revised version of the module addressing all the above issues:

```verilog
module fixed_point_subtractor #(
    parameter Q = 16,  // Number of fractional bits
    parameter N = 32   // Total number of bits
)(
    input  [N-1:0] a, // First fixed-point input operand
    input  [N-1:0] b, // Second fixed-point input operand
    output reg [N-1:0] c // Result of the fixed-point subtraction
);
    
    always @* begin
        // Compute the subtraction (signed logic)
        c = a - b;

        // Logic to handle overflow (if needed, depending on the definition of behavior)
        // This handles the zero condition inherently as c would be zero if res is zero.
        if (c[N-1] != a[N-1] && c[N-1] != b[N-1]) begin
            // Overflow condition detected, inverting result or clamping to maximum could be implemented here.
            // Depending on design, you may want to set c to maximum/minimum instead of an inverted result.
            c = (a[N-1] == 1'b0) ? {1'b0, {N-1{1'b1}}} : {1'b1, {N-1{1'b0}}}; // Set c to +MAX or -MAX based on sign of 'a'
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Key Changes:
1. Simplified the computation to just directly compute `c = a - b;`.
2. Added a conditional check for overflow/underflow that captures cases when the sign change happens unexpectedly.
3. Used non-blocking assignment (`<=`) if using flip-flop or clocked logic, but kept combinatorial (`=`) since there is no clock in this context.
4. Removed unnecessary checks for zero; the assignment should naturally handle this.
5. Included a basic mechanism to set `c` to either the maximum or minimum allowable values in case of overflow; this could be tailored to specific requirements based on design needs. 

Always remember to validate specific design requirements or any corner case definitions required by your design or specification after any changes made.
