The provided Verilog module has a few considerations and improvements we can make:

1. **Synthesis-Friendliness**: `always @*` is generally acceptable, but the use of integers in combination with a loop can create some synthesis issues. It is better to use a fixed-size index type, such as `genvar` in `generate` blocks when appropriate or `localparam` for constants, but in this case, we will keep it simple since you are using it in an `always` block.

2. **Output Initialization**: The output `out` should have a clear initial value to avoid synthesis issues with X states. Initializing registers in the always block can help.

3. **Code Readability and Clarity**: Using a `generate` block or `loop` would enhance readability, but if this is not a synthesizable pattern in your target architecture, we will retain the usage of the `always` block with a loop.

Given these considerations, here is the corrected and improved version of your module with minor adjustments for best practices:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output reg [99:0] out
);
    integer i;

    always @* begin
        // Initialize output to prevent unknown states
        out = 100'b0; // An explicit initialization of out
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin
            out[i] = in[99 - i];
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Output Initialization**: Added `out = 100'b0;` to ensure `out` starts with a defined state (all zeros) before being modified in the loop.
  
2. **Continued Use of the `always @*`**: Retained the use of `always @*` for combinational logic with sensitivity to all inputs, which is appropriate.

This corrected module avoids potential pitfalls in synthesis and ensures cleaner output behavior.
