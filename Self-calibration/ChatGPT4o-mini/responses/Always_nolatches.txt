The provided Verilog code looks mostly fine, but there are a couple of improvements that we can make to enhance clarity and maintain best practices:

1. The `default` case in the `case` statement executes a block that reaffirms all the outputs to zero. While this could be a valid case, it is redundant since all outputs are already being set to zero at the beginning of the `always` block. It’s unnecessary to have the `default` case doing this redundant resetting.

2. The comment style is consistent, but for clarity, I will insert more explanatory comments to make it more understandable for someone reading the code in the future.

Here’s the corrected version of the module with improvements:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up
); 

    always @(*) begin
        // Initialize outputs to zero
        up = 1'b0; 
        down = 1'b0; 
        left = 1'b0; 
        right = 1'b0;
        
        // Check the scancode and set the corresponding output high
        case (scancode)
            16'hE06B: left = 1'b1;  // left arrow key pressed
            16'hE072: down = 1'b1;  // down arrow key pressed
            16'hE074: right = 1'b1; // right arrow key pressed
            16'hE075: up = 1'b1;    // up arrow key pressed
            // No need for a default case; outputs are initialized to zero
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Removed the redundant `default` case inside the `case` statement since the output signals are already initialized to `0` at the beginning of the `always` block.
- Added comments to clarify the purpose of the initialization and the `case` checks.

These changes maintain the module's functionality while improving readability and adhering to best practices.
