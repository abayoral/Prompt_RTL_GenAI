The provided Verilog code has a few issues that need correction and refinement for better clarity and adherence to best practices. Here are the noted errors and improvements:

1. **Output Port `cout`**: The module's output `cout` is defined as a 100-bit vector, but it's being wired directly to the `carry` vector which only has significance at the last stage of carrying. Specifically, the `cout` should ideally represent the carry out of the most significant bit (MSB) and should be a single bit.

2. **Redundant Carry Output**: If you are only looking to capture the final carry-out bit, you can simply assign `cout` to `carry[99]` (the carry out from the last full adder) instead of outputting the entire `carry` vector.

3. **Input/Output Signal Widths**: The module's width of carry is redundant since the final carry-out can simply be one bit. 

Here is the revised Verilog code with corrections applied:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output sum [99:0],
    output cout );  // Changed cout to a 1-bit output

    wire [99:0] carry;

    // Instantiate 100 full adders
    genvar i;
    generate
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin: full_adder
            if (i == 0) begin
                full_adder fa (
                    .a(a[i]),
                    .b(b[i]),
                    .cin(cin),
                    .sum(sum[i]),
                    .cout(carry[i])
                );
            end else begin
                full_adder fa (
                    .a(a[i]),
                    .b(b[i]),
                    .cin(carry[i-1]),
                    .sum(sum[i]),
                    .cout(carry[i])
                );
            end
        end
    endgenerate

    assign cout = carry[99]; // Assign only the final carry out

endmodule

module full_adder (
    input a, b, cin,
    output sum, cout
);
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;
    assign cout = (a & b) | (cin & (a ^ b));
endmodule
```

### Key Changes Made:
- Changed the type of `cout` from a 100-bit vector to a single-bit output.
- Assigned `cout` to `carry[99]`, which represents the carry-out of the most significant bit add operation.

This corrected module now adheres to standard naming and best practices while avoiding unnecessary redundancy.
