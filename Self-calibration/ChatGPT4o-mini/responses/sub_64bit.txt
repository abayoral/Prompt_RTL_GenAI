The provided Verilog code contains a logical error in the overflow detection for a subtraction operation. Specifically, the calculations for detecting overflow when subtracting two signed numbers are not correct. 

The overflow cases for subtraction can be detected by the following logic:
1. If A is positive (`A[63] == 0`), B is negative (`B[63] == 1`), and the result is negative (`result[63] == 1`), then an overflow has occurred.
2. If A is negative (`A[63] == 1`), B is positive (`B[63] == 0`), and the result is positive (`result[63] == 0`), then an overflow has occurred.

Here is the corrected version of the module, along with some minor improvements in style:

```verilog
module sub_64bit (
    input  [63:0] A,
    input  [63:0] B,
    output [63:0] result,
    output        overflow
);

    wire [63:0] B_negated;
    assign B_negated = ~B + 1; // Two's complement to get -B
    assign result = A + B_negated; // A - B is the same as A + (-B)

    // Corrected overflow detection
    assign overflow = ((A[63] == 0 && B[63] == 1 && result[63] == 1) ||  // A positive, B negative, result negative
                       (A[63] == 1 && B[63] == 0 && result[63] == 0) ||  // A negative, B positive, result positive
                       (A[63] == 1 && B[63] == 1 && result[63] == 0) ||  // A negative, B negative, result positive
                       (A[63] == 0 && B[63] == 0 && result[63] == 1));    // A positive, B positive, result negative

endmodule
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Overflow Detection Fix**: I fixed the overflow logic, ensuring it correctly reflects the signed nature of the operands when performing subtraction via addition of the two's complement.
2. **Comment Improvements**: Added comments to clarify overflow conditions more explicitly.

This corrected version should accurately detect overflow for 64-bit signed integers when performing subtraction.
