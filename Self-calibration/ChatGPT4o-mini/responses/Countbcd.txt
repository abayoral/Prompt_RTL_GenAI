The provided Verilog code has some logical issues in the counting sequence as well as some minor improvements that can be made to adhere to best practices. Here's a corrected version of the code along with an explanation of the changes:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,   // Synchronous active-high reset
    output [3:1] ena,
    output [15:0] q
);
    reg [3:0] ones;
    reg [3:0] tens;
    reg [3:0] hundreds;
    reg [3:0] thousands;

    // Concatenates the registers into a single 16-bit output
    assign q = {thousands, hundreds, tens, ones};
    
    // Enables for the next decade
    assign ena[1] = (ones == 4'd9) && (tens != 4'd9);
    assign ena[2] = (tens == 4'd9) && (hundreds != 4'd9);
    assign ena[3] = (hundreds == 4'd9) && (thousands != 4'd9);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            ones <= 4'b0000;
            tens <= 4'b0000;
            hundreds <= 4'b0000;
            thousands <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            if (ones == 4'd9) begin
                ones <= 4'b0000; // Reset ones to 0
                if (tens == 4'd9) begin
                    tens <= 4'b0000; // Reset tens to 0
                    if (hundreds == 4'd9) begin
                        hundreds <= 4'b0000; // Reset hundreds to 0
                        if (thousands == 4'd9) begin
                            thousands <= 4'd9; // Hold at 9 if max count reached
                        end else begin
                            thousands <= thousands + 1; // Increment thousands
                        end
                    end else begin
                        hundreds <= hundreds + 1; // Increment hundreds
                    end
                end else begin
                    tens <= tens + 1; // Increment tens
                end
            end else begin
                ones <= ones + 1; // Increment ones
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Critical Corrections and Changes:

1. **Logical Issue in Counting**:
   - In the original code, the logic to handle the thousands was incorrect. The condition checked if `thousands != 4'd9` which didn't correctly handle how to proceed once thousands reached 9.
   - Now, it checks for `thousands == 4'd9`, and if it's already 9, it holds the value instead of incrementing.

2. **Simplicity**:
   - The code structure remains largely the same, but the logic has been adjusted for clarity.

3. **Output Size**:
   - The `q` output should indeed be 16 bits as defined by combining four 4-bit registers.

### Best Practices:
- Always use meaningful comments to demarcate areas of logic for easier readability.
- Ensure that the values are held properly when counting reaches its maximum; validate inputs where necessary.
- Using `4'd9` for clarity indicates that it is binary-decimal format representing 9.

This revised implementation should work as intended without logical errors.
