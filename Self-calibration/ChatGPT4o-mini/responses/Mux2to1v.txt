The provided Verilog code is structurally correct and correctly implements a multiplexer behavior where the output `out` is selected between inputs `a` and `b` based on the `sel` signal. However, there are a few best practices and minor improvements that can enhance clarity and maintainability. 

Here are some improvements to consider: 

1. **Parameterize widths**: Using parameters for the width can make the module more adaptable.
2. **Naming conventions**: Using clearer naming conventions can improve the readability of the code.
3. **Output declaration**: Including `reg` type for combinational logic can improve clarity for synthesis tools.

Here's the revised code following these guidelines:

```verilog
module top_module #(parameter WIDTH = 100) ( 
    input [WIDTH-1:0] a, b,
    input sel,
    output reg [WIDTH-1:0] out 
);

    always @(*) begin
        out = sel ? b : a;
    end

endmodule
```

### Changes:
1. **Parameterized width**: The width of the inputs and outputs is parameterized (`WIDTH`), which allows this module to be reused with different bit widths without changing its code.
   
2. **Always block**: The output is driven inside an `always` block, making it explicitly combinational. While the original code is valid, this style is often preferred for clarity in designs involving multiplexers.

3. **Output as `reg`**: The `output` type is declared as `reg`, which is necessary when using an `always` block in Verilog.

The corrected module is now more flexible and adheres to good design practices while maintaining the original intended functionality.
