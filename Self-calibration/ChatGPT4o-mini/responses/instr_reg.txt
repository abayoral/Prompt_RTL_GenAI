Upon reviewing the provided Verilog module, I identified a few potential issues and areas for improvement. 

### Issues Found
1. **Asynchronous Reset Signal**: The `negedge rst` is typically used for reset signals but is likely not appropriate in this context if it is an active-high reset, which is more common. This should be an active-high reset signal (i.e., `posedge`).
  
2. **Incomplete Case Handling**: The `default` case in the `case(fetch)` statement does not explicitly handle a scenario where `fetch` might not match any of the defined cases. It’s generally a good practice to define how to handle unexpected values.

3. **Uninitialized Outputs**: The outputs `ins`, `ad1`, and `ad2` are combinatorial outputs defined in an always block, but this can lead to simulation mismatches if inputs are utilized in a way where they may not be driven under all circumstances. 

4. **Best Practices**: It's better to explicitly declare all output registers to avoid unexpected behavior. It’s also good to ensure all outputs are initialized in a reset condition if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the code accounting for these improvements:

```verilog
module instr_reg (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,  // assuming active high reset
    input wire [1:0] fetch,
    input wire [7:0] data,
    output reg [2:0] ins,
    output reg [4:0] ad1,
    output reg [7:0] ad2
);

    reg [7:0] ins_p1;
    reg [7:0] ins_p2;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin  // Active high reset
            ins_p1 <= 8'b0;
            ins_p2 <= 8'b0;
            ins <= 3'b0;   // Clear outputs on reset
            ad1 <= 5'b0;
            ad2 <= 8'b0;
        end else begin
            case (fetch)
                2'b01: ins_p1 <= data; // Fetch instruction from data to ins_p1
                2'b10: ins_p2 <= data; // Fetch instruction from data to ins_p2
                default: ; // Retain current values in ins_p1 and ins_p2
            endcase
        end
    end

    always @(*) begin
        ins = ins_p1[7:5]; // High 3 bits for opcode
        ad1 = ins_p1[4:0]; // Low 5 bits for register address
        ad2 = ins_p2;      // Complete 8-bit data from ins_p2
    end

endmodule
```

### Summary of Changes
- Changed the reset condition to `posedge rst` from `negedge rst`.
- Added initialization for the outputs `ins`, `ad1`, and `ad2` to avoid unknown states.
- Kept the default case in the `case` statement (it retains current values), but you might want to add a complete handling mechanism if required for your use case.
  
This revised module should function more reliably and adhere better to standard practices for designing synchronous digital circuits in Verilog.
