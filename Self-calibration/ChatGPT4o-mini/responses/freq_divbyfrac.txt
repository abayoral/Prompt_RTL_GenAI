The given Verilog module `freq_divbyfrac` has several logical and structural issues. The major problems include:

1. The use of the `clk_phase1` and `clk_phase2` signals is not properly cascading through the counter states. Variables should be set to zero after their corresponding phases are done.
2. The counter logic does not correctly handle the time durations for when the respective phases should be active.
3. The parameter `MUL2_DIV_CLK` is not utilized, and a comment states it differently than what the actual numbers indicate (i.e., the counter values).
4. The approach to derive `clk_div` can be simplified.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the Verilog code:

```verilog
module freq_divbyfrac (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    output reg clk_div
);

    localparam DIV_CLK = 7; // Total clock periods for division
    reg [2:0] counter; // 3-bit counter for counting clock cycles
    
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            counter <= 0;
            clk_div <= 0;
        end else begin
            if (counter < DIV_CLK - 1) begin
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end else begin
                counter <= 0; // Reset counter after reaching DIV_CLK - 1
            end
            
            // Generate clk_div: active for the first 4 clock cycles, then low for 3 cycles
            if (counter < 4) begin
                clk_div <= 1; // First 4 cycles high
            end else begin
                clk_div <= 0; // Last 3 cycles low
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Corrections made:

1. **Consolidated Logic**: Removed `clk_phase1` and `clk_phase2`, using a simpler logic for `clk_div` directly based on the `counter`.
2. **Correct Counter Condition**: The code is set up so that the counter wraps around correctly after reaching `DIV_CLK`, which is defined as 7.
3. **Simplified `clk_div` Logic**: Now, `clk_div` depends on the result of the counter conditions directly, thus simplifying the signal generation.
4. **Removed Redundant Variable Usage**: Both `clk_phase1` and `clk_phase2` are eliminated because their logic was encapsulated into the `clk_div` signal.

With these modifications, the module retains the desired frequency division functionality while improving efficiency and clarity.
