The provided Verilog module looks mostly correct, but there are some improvements and best practices that can be applied:

1. Use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`) in the `always` block is typically correct for sequential logic (registers), but if you're intending for the output to reflect the input at each clock edge, it's fine as is.
2. Including a reset signal is often a good practice in synchronous designs to handle initialization and avoid unknown states.
3. Commenting for clarity and future references can also improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Here's a revised version of the module incorporating a reset signal and comments for clarity:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,              // Clock input
    input rst_n,           // Active low reset input
    input [7:0] d,         // 8-bit data input
    output reg [7:0] q     // 8-bit output register
);
    // Synchronous process for updating output 'q' with the input 'd'
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            q <= 8'b0;     // Reset 'q' to 0 on reset
        end else begin
            q <= d;        // Store 'd' into 'q' on clock edge
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Reset Signal**: Added an active-low reset input (`rst_n`) that initializes `q` to `0` when asserted.
2. **Comments**: Added comments for clarity on inputs, outputs, and the functionality of the always block. This helps with code maintenance.
3. **Behavior**: The output `q` is now clearly defined to reset, ensuring that initial states are well defined (avoiding unknown states).

This version ensures that `q` starts in a known state and follows best practices for synchronous design, including reset handling.
