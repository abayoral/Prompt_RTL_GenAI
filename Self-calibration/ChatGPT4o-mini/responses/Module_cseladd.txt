The provided Verilog code contains several issues, logical inconsistencies, and syntactical mistakes. Here are the identified problems:

1. **Module Recursion**: The module `add16` is recursively instantiated within itself. It should not instantiate itself. Instead, it should use a simple calculation for the addition which can be done using a lower-level operator or instance of a smaller adder.

2. **Bit Width Mismatch**: The calls to `a` and `b` in some instances are referencing incorrect bit ranges. For example, `a[31:16]` assumes that `a` is wider than 16 bits, which it isn't.

3. **The `cout` output is not driven correctly**: The carry out of the entire adder should be generated from the last stage of the addition.

4. **The second adder instance is not needed for computing the result**: There's no need to create two separate sum outputs for the addition with and without carry for the 16-bit adder.

5. **Incorrect use of temporary variable sizes**: The temporary arrays `sum0`, `sum1`, etc., do not match the expected inputs and outputs.

6. **Handling carry out and selecting sums**: The logic for deciding `sum` and `cout` is flawed and needs a corrected and simplified logic.

Here's a corrected version of the Verilog code that adheres to better practices:

```verilog
module add16 (
    input [15:0] a,
    input [15:0] b,
    input cin,
    output [15:0] sum,
    output cout
);
    wire [15:0] sum_internal;
    wire carry_internal;

    assign {carry_internal, sum_internal} = a + b + cin; // Simple addition logic

    assign sum = sum_internal;
    assign cout = carry_internal;

endmodule

module mux2x1 (
    input [15:0] a,
    input [15:0] b,
    input sel,
    output [15:0] y
);
    assign y = sel ? b : a;
endmodule
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Simplified Addition**: The addition is done using a single addition statement which computes both the sum and carry.
   
2. **Correct Outputs**: The `sum` is directly assigned from the internal sum calculation, while `cout` is directly assigned from the carry.

3. **Removed Recursion**: Removed the self-reference of the `add16` to avoid recursion.

4. **Corrected Bit Width**: Ensures all ports and wires are accurately referenced with respect to their bit width.

This corrected version is more efficient, adheres to correct wiring principles, and obviates unnecessary complexity.
