The provided Verilog code is mostly correct, but there are a few improvements we can make for best practices.

1. **Port Declaration**: It's generally a good practice to specify the width of the port explicitly, even though `one` can be inferred as a single bit based on the type. It enhances readability and clarity.

2. **Module Declaration**: It's a good practice to specify the input and output port widths consistently. In this example, since `one` is a single bit output, we can declare it as `output wire [0:0] one;`.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    output wire one // Explicitly specify the type as wire
);

    assign one = 1'b1; // Assign a constant value of 1

endmodule
```

### Changes made:
- Explicitly declared `one` as `output wire` for clarity. This can help avoid ambiguity and ensure that the synthesized hardware behaves as intended. 

### Summary:
The original module had no syntax errors but could be improved for readability and adherence to best practices as shown in the corrected version.
