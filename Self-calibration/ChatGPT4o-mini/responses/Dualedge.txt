The provided Verilog module has the following issues:

1. **Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments**: In the combinational block (`always @(*)`), the assignment to `q` is done using `=` (blocking assignment). Instead, since `q` is a `reg` that gets its value from a sequential logic process, it should be assigned using `<=` (non-blocking assignment) to ensure it captures the previous value correctly without race conditions.
  
2. **Incomplete Logic**: The current logic in the `always @(*)` block combines the outputs of the two flip-flops with a logical OR. While this is not necessarily wrong, it's not clear if that is the intended functionality. It suggests that `q` should represent the logical OR of two flip-flops, which may be desirable, but it would be good to clarify the design intent.

3. **Unused Registers**: The registers `d_flip_flop_pos` and `d_flip_flop_neg` might be unnecessary, depending on the desired functionality. If you simply want a D flip-flop for the rising edge and another for the falling edge, the description could be simplified.

Here's a corrected and improved version of the module, assuming the intention is to retain the values in both flip-flops without combining them via OR:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q_pos,
    output reg q_neg
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;  // On rising edge, store d in q_pos
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;  // On falling edge, store d in q_neg
    end

endmodule
```

### Changes Made:
- Separate outputs `q_pos` and `q_neg` are created instead of a single `q` output to directly reflect the outputs of the flip-flops.
- Retained non-blocking assignments (`<=`) to ensure correct sequencing in the flip-flop behavior.
- Removed unused intermediate registers (`d_flip_flop_pos` and `d_flip_flop_neg`) for clarity and efficiency.

### Best Practices:
- Use meaningful output names to enhance modular understanding.
- Non-blocking assignments are employed for sequential logic to avoid timing issues.
- Consider documenting the design intent for combinational logic if required.
