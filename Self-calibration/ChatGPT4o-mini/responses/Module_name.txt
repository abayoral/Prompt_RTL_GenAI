The provided Verilog code has a couple of issues related to module structure and port connections. Here are the identified issues and their corrections:

1. **Missing Port Declaration in `mod_a`**:
   The `mod_a` module does not define internal logic or a way to connect to the outputs. Although this is mentioned as "Module implementation goes here", it's essential to ensure that it has meaningful behavior, even if it's a simple example for the verification purpose.

2. **Best Practices**:
   It's good practice to include `reg` types or `wire` types for the outputs of `mod_a`. Also, we should ensure that the module explicitly defines internal behavior.

3. **Default Values**:
   In real designs, consider initializing outputs to prevent latches in simulation (if applicable), though for simple combinational logic, it's mainly stylistic.

Here is a corrected version of the module including a simple implementation for `mod_a`:

```verilog
module mod_a ( 
    output wire out1, 
    output wire out2, 
    input wire in1, 
    input wire in2, 
    input wire in3, 
    input wire in4 
);

    // Example implementation (simple OR and AND gates)
    assign out1 = in1 | in2; // out1 is the logical OR of in1 and in2
    assign out2 = in3 & in4; // out2 is the logical AND of in3 and in4

endmodule

module top_module ( 
    input wire a, 
    input wire b, 
    input wire c, 
    input wire d, 
    output wire out1, 
    output wire out2 
);

    mod_a instance_name (
        .out1(out1), 
        .out2(out2), 
        .in1(a), 
        .in2(b), 
        .in3(c), 
        .in4(d)
    );

endmodule
```

### Corrections Made:
1. **Defined Outputs as Wires**: I specified `output wire` for `out1` and `out2` in `mod_a`, which aligns with best practices in Verilog. Similarly, `input` ports are explicitly defined as `input wire`.

2. **Implemented Logic**: I added a simple logical OR (`out1`) and AND (`out2`) operation for illustrative purposes.

This structure ensures the module can be synthesized correctly and adheres to common coding conventions in Verilog.
