The provided Verilog code has several issues that need to be corrected. Below are the primary problems identified:

1. **Reset Logic**: The `done` signal should be set to 0 when the FSM enters the `IDLE` state after reset. The `done` signal should also be assigned before moving to `next_state` in the state transitions.

2. **Byte Counter Logic**: The `byte_counter` should be registered (like `current_state`), but it was inadvertently assigned combinatorially. Additionally, it should be reset to zero on the `IDLE` transition immediately rather than using the non-blocking assignment.

3. **State Update**: Since `next_state` is calculated combinatorially, it should ideally not include assignments of registered variables like `byte_counter` directly; instead, use a non-blocking assignment in the clock edge triggered block.

4. **Default Assignment**: The `next_state` and `done` signals may not have complete coverage or initialization prior to conditions.

5. **Unused input between states**: The `in` input should be captured only when needed. The logic doesn't provide safeguards against unexpected states.

Here is a corrected version of the original module adhering to best practices:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output reg [23:0] out_bytes,
    output reg done
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        IDLE,
        BYTE1,
        BYTE2,
        BYTE3
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    reg [7:0] byte_counter;

    // FSM - State Transition
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
            byte_counter <= 0;
            out_bytes <= 24'b0;
            done <= 0;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next State Logic and Output Logic
    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignments for the next state and done signal
        next_state = current_state;
        done = 0;

        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in[3] == 1) begin
                    next_state = BYTE1;
                    byte_counter = 0;    // Reset the byte counter
                end
            end
            BYTE1: begin
                out_bytes[23:16] = in; // Capture first byte
                byte_counter = 1;
                next_state = BYTE2;
            end
            BYTE2: begin
                out_bytes[15:8] = in; // Capture second byte
                byte_counter = 2;
                next_state = BYTE3;
            end
            BYTE3: begin
                out_bytes[7:0] = in; // Capture third byte
                done = 1;            // Signal done
                next_state = IDLE;  // Return to idle
            end
        endcase
    end
    
endmodule
```

Key changes made include:

- The assignment of `done`, `out_bytes`, and `byte_counter` is appropriately done in the state machine.
- The `next_state` and `done` signals have clear default assignments at the beginning of the `always @(*)` block, which ensures they are properly initialized.
- The code adheres to synchronous design by using non-blocking assignments where necessary.

This corrected version should function correctly and adhere to good design practices in Verilog.
