Upon analyzing the provided Verilog code for the frequency divider module `freq_divbyodd`, I have identified some potential improvements and corrections:

1. **Unused Variables**: The `clk_div2` variable is not necessary and can be removed unless it serves a specific purpose in your design; the current implementation isn't using both clocks meaningfully.

2. **Clock Domain Considerations**: Combining clock signals (`clk_div1` and `clk_div2`) should ideally be done in a synchronous manner to avoid potential metastability issues.

3. **Reset Logic**: Make sure that the output `clk_div` is also reset when `rst_n` is low. 

4. **Output Assignment**: Assigning `clk_div` in a combinational block from flip-flops is not optimal. Instead, use a sequential block for the `clk_div` output.

5. **Parameter Validity**: The parameter `NUM_DIV` should be checked to ensure it does not result in invalid counting (e.g., it should be at least 1).

Here is the corrected version of the code, maintaining best practices:

```verilog
module freq_divbyodd #(
    parameter NUM_DIV = 5  // Ensure NUM_DIV is at least 1; ideally, add checks or constraints.
)(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    output reg clk_div
);

    // Ensure NUM_DIV must be greater than zero
    initial begin
        if (NUM_DIV < 1) begin
            $error("NUM_DIV must be at least 1");
        end
    end

    reg [31:0] cnt; // Unified counter for the clock divider
    reg clk_div_internal; // Internal divided clock

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            cnt <= 0;
            clk_div_internal <= 0;
            clk_div <= 0; // Reset clk_div
        end else begin
            if (cnt < (NUM_DIV - 1)) begin
                cnt <= cnt + 1;
            end else begin
                cnt <= 0;
                clk_div_internal <= ~clk_div_internal; // Toggle clk_div_internal on reaching NUM_DIV
            end
        end
    end

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            clk_div <= 0; // Ensure clk_div is reset
        end else begin
            clk_div <= clk_div_internal; // Assign internal divided clock to output
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes Made:
- Merged the two counters into one, reducing redundant logic.
- Used an initial block to provide an error if `NUM_DIV` is invalid. However, if synthesis tools do not support runtime assertions, consider that in simulation only.
- Changed the output assignment to occur within an edge-triggered block to maintain synchronous design practices. 
- Ensured the output `clk_div` is reset as needed. 

These changes improve clarity, reduce unnecessary complexity, and align the code better with synchronous design best practices.
