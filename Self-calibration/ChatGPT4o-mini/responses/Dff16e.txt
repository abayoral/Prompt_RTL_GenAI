The provided Verilog code appears to have the correct logic for updating the output `q` based on the `byteena` input, but there are a couple of improvements that can be made to enhance clarity and ensure best practices.

1. **Initialization on Reset**: The current logic sets `q` to zero when reset is asserted. This works in most cases, but it is often good practice to also clear the data when `byteena` signals change.
2. **Handling Incomplete Updates**: Depending on the `byteena` signals, portions of `q` may not get updated in a single clock cycle, which is generally acceptable. However, it's good practice to ensure that all relevant sections of `q` are accounted for when `byteena` changes.
3. **Mechanical Formatting**: It's always good to maintain a consistent style and clarity in comments.

Considering those points, here's a slightly improved version:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input resetn,
    input [1:0] byteena,
    input [15:0] d,
    output reg [15:0] q
);

    // On the positive edge of the clock
    always @(posedge clk or negedge resetn) begin
        if (!resetn) begin
            // Asynchronously reset q to 0
            q <= 16'b0;
        end else begin
            // Update q based on byteena
            if (byteena[0]) begin
                q[7:0] <= d[7:0];    // Update lower byte
            end
            if (byteena[1]) begin
                q[15:8] <= d[15:8];  // Update upper byte
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Changes Made:
- **Reset Condition**: Added `negedge resetn` to the sensitivity list of the always block, allowing asynchronous reset behavior.
- **Comments**: Added comments for clarity regarding each operation.
- **Overall Structure**: Maintained the original structure while ensuring readability and best practices.

This code should function correctly in accordance with typical usage and design practices in Verilog.
