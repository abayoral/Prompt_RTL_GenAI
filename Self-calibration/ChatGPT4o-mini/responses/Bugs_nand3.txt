The provided Verilog code is mostly correct, but there are some improvements and best practice adjustments to be made. 

1. **Unused Inputs**: The approach of using constant `1'b1` values for the unused inputs in the `andgate` module is acceptable, but it may lead to confusion. It is better to comment clearly or modify the design to avoid misinterpretation.

2. **Output Declaration**: In the `top_module`, the internal `and_out` wire is properly defined; however, we should ensure that the overall declaration style adheres to best practices.

3. **Syntax Improvement**: The ports in the instance of `andgate` should ideally be connected using named ports for better clarity.

4. **Module Naming**: While "top_module" is acceptable, it could be more descriptive of the functionality.

Here is the corrected and improved version of the Verilog code:

```verilog
// 2-input AND gate with 5 inputs
module andgate (
    output out, 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c, 
    input d, 
    input e
);
    assign out = a & b & c & d & e; // AND operation on all inputs
endmodule

// Top-level module performing a NAND operation using an andgate
module nand_gate (
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c, 
    output out
);
    wire and_out;

    // Instance of the andgate
    andgate inst1 (
        .out(and_out), // Named port connection for clarity
        .a(a), 
        .b(b), 
        .c(c), 
        .d(1'b1), // Using constant 1's for unused inputs
        .e(1'b1)
    );

    assign out = ~(and_out); // NAND operation
endmodule
```

### Summary of Changes:
- **Module Naming**: Changed `top_module` to `nand_gate` for clarity.
- **Named Port Connections**: Used named port connections for better readability and maintainability.
- **Documentation and Comments**: Improved comments for better understanding of functionality.

This version of the code maintains the intended functionality while adhering to best coding practices.
