The provided Verilog code for the `traffic_light` module does have a few issues that need to be addressed. Here are the corrections with explanations:

1. **Nonsensical Use of `pass_request`:** The logic condition that checks if `cnt` is greater than 10 in the green state is somewhat unclear and could lead to unexpected behavior. Here, we would typically want to handle requests when in the green state depending on system requirements.

2. **Counter Initialization:** The counter `cnt` is not being reset correctly based on the state transitions. We should ensure it starts counting down from the correct initial value when moving to a new state.

3. **Improper Handling of `clock`:** The assignment `clock <= cnt;` is ambiguous; it's not clear if it represents a typical clock signal.

4. **Reset Condition:** It's useful to reset output states (red, yellow, green) on the reset condition.

5. **Case default behavior:** The `default:;` case in state outputs does nothing and can be removed.

Here is a corrected version of the `traffic_light` module incorporating the above considerations:

```verilog
module traffic_light (
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire clk,
    input wire pass_request,
    output reg [7:0] clock,
    output reg red,
    output reg yellow,
    output reg green
);

    parameter idle = 2'b00;
    parameter s1_red = 2'b01;
    parameter s2_yellow = 2'b10;
    parameter s3_green = 2'b11;

    reg [1:0] state, next_state;
    reg [7:0] cnt;

    // Timing constants
    localparam GREEN_TIME = 8'd60;
    localparam YELLOW_TIME = 8'd5;
    localparam RED_TIME = 8'd10;

    // State Transition Logic
    always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            state <= idle;
            cnt <= 0;
            clock <= 0;
            red <= 0;
            yellow <= 0;
            green <= 0;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next State Logic
    always @ (*) begin
        case (state)
            idle: next_state = s1_red;
            s1_red: begin
                if (cnt == 0)
                    next_state = s2_yellow;
                else
                    next_state = s1_red;
            end
            s2_yellow: begin
                if (cnt == 0)
                    next_state = s3_green;
                else
                    next_state = s2_yellow;
            end
            s3_green: begin
                if (cnt == 0)
                    next_state = s1_red;
                else
                    next_state = s3_green;
            end
            default: next_state = idle;
        endcase
    end

    // Counter Logic
    always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            cnt <= 8'd0;
            clock <= 8'd0;
        end else begin
            if (cnt == 0) begin
                case (next_state)
                    s1_red: cnt <= RED_TIME;
                    s2_yellow: cnt <= YELLOW_TIME;
                    s3_green: begin
                        if (pass_request && (cnt > 10)) 
                            cnt <= 10;  // Reduce to 10 if more than 10 cycles remain
                        else
                            cnt <= GREEN_TIME;
                    end
                endcase
            end else begin
                cnt <= cnt - 1;
            end
            
            // Update clock as a simple countdown value based on time remaining
            clock <= cnt; 
        end
    end

    // Updating Output Signals
    always @ (*) begin
        // Default Outputs
        red = 0;
        yellow = 0;
        green = 0;

        case (state)
            s1_red: red = 1;
            s2_yellow: yellow = 1;
            s3_green: green = 1;
            default: ;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Reset of state variables to default values in the reset logic.
- The counter is properly initialized based on entering each state.
- The `clock` output is decremented as expected, matching the countdown timer.
- Clarified counter initialization logic for smoother state transitions.
