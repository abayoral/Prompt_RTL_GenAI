The provided Verilog code for the 8-bit multiplier is mostly correct but contains two issues related to synthesizability and code best practices:

1. The `integer` declaration for the loop variable `i` is not synthesizable and should be declared as a `reg` or a `genvar` if it is intended for a generate statement.
2. The way the product is computed using `product` under the `always @(*)` block can lead to synthesis issues. Depending on the synthesis tool, the logic might not be optimized correctly for hardware. It is generally preferred to avoid continuous assignment in a clocked process unless necessary. 

A better approach is to use a clocked process (though not typically necessary for combinatorial logic like this). If we want to keep the current approach, we must ensure the index variable is declared properly, and we should pad the `A` shifted value adequately depending on the width of `B`.

Here's the corrected version of the module:

```verilog
module multi_8bit (
    input  [7:0] A,
    input  [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] product
);

    // Declare i as a reg type that is appropriate for loop control in a combinatorial block.
    reg [3:0] i; // We only need a 4-bit register since i ranges from 0 to 7

    always @(*) begin
        product = 16'b0; // Initialize product to 0
        for (i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
            if (B[i]) begin
                product = product + (A << i); // Add shifted A to product if B[i] is 1
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. Changed the declaration of `i` from `integer` to `reg [3:0] i`.
2. The rest of the code is structurally correct with respect to the functionality intended for an 8x8 multiplication in combinatorial logic.

This version should be synthesizable and correctly define the behavior of an 8-bit multiplier. Note that in practical designs, a more efficient implementation (like using DSP blocks or dedicated multiplier modules) would often be preferred for performance efficiency.
