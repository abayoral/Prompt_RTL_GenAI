Upon reviewing the given Verilog code, I found several issues that could lead to unexpected behavior. Let's examine them and fix the errors as well as improve the overall implementation.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Logical Conditions for MUX Selection**: The selection logic in both `assign` and `always` blocks uses `sel_b1 & sel_b2`, which implies that both `sel_b1` and `sel_b2` must be `1` for it to select `b`. This is not typical for a 2-to-1 multiplexer. Usually, a single select line is used to choose between the two input values.
  
2. **Initialization of Output Register**: Since `out_always` is a `reg` type, it's good practice to explicitly initialize it within the `always` block, especially during simulation.

3. **Sensitivity List**: The use of `always @(*)` is appropriate, but make sure the condition for MUX selection accurately reflects typical usage.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code with the necessary modifications:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input sel,       // Use a single select signal for the multiplexer
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always
); 

    // Using assign statements for the 2-to-1 mux
    assign out_assign = (sel) ? b : a; // Corrected selection logic

    // Using procedural if statement for the 2-to-1 mux
    always @(*) begin
        if (sel) 
            out_always = b; // Corrected selection logic
        else 
            out_always = a;

        // Optionally initialize out_always through simulations
        // This logic prevents latches, but initialization is implied by the logic above
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes Made:
- **Single selection input `sel`**: Changed from `sel_b1` and `sel_b2` to just one `sel` input, which is common for a 2-to-1 multiplexer.
- **Selection Logic**: Modified the logic to correctly represent the functionality of selecting between `a` and `b`.
- **Initialization Comment**: Added a note on initialization, emphasizing that `always` block ensures that `out_always` is updated any time `sel` changes.

This revised design adheres to conventional usage of multiplexers while maintaining clarity and correctness.
