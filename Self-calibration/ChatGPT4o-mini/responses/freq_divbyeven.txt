The provided Verilog code has a couple of issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Counter Size**: The counter `cnt` is defined as 4 bits, which can count from 0 to 15. This would be fine for dividing by even numbers up to 16, but for a more general approach, we should make sure the counter size accommodates the required division safely. If `NUM_DIV` is large, this might not hold true.

2. **Division Logic**: The condition for the counter seems incorrect since it should include the maximum value it can reach based on `NUM_DIV`. The condition `(NUM_DIV / 2) - 1` will not toggle properly if the division is incorrect or if `NUM_DIV` is very small.

3. **Parameter Validation**: `NUM_DIV` should only accept even values, which could be enforced by adding assertions.

Here's the corrected version of the module, taking into account the aforementioned points and ensuring best practices:

```verilog
module freq_diveven #(
    parameter NUM_DIV = 2  // Parameter for frequency division; must be even
) (
    input wire clk,         // Input clock signal
    input wire rst_n,      // Active-low reset signal
    output reg clk_div      // Divided clock output signal
);
    
    // Assert to check if NUM_DIV is even and greater than or equal to 2
    initial begin
        if (NUM_DIV < 2 || NUM_DIV % 2 != 0) begin
            $error("NUM_DIV must be even and at least 2"); 
            disable freq_diveven;  // Disable the module if the condition is not met
        end
    end

    reg [$clog2(NUM_DIV)-1:0] cnt; // Counter based on number of bits needed for NUM_DIV

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            cnt <= 0;        // Reset counter to 0
            clk_div <= 0;    // Reset divided clock to 0
        end else begin
            if (cnt < NUM_DIV / 2 - 1) begin
                cnt <= cnt + 1;  // Increment counter
            end else begin
                cnt <= 0;            // Reset counter
                clk_div <= ~clk_div; // Toggle divided clock
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes:
- **Counter Bit Width Calculation**: The counter size is now dynamically sized using `$clog2(NUM_DIV)` to ensure it can handle the maximum value needed for the count depending on `NUM_DIV`.
- **Input Validation**: An initialization block has been added to assert that `NUM_DIV` is an even number and at least 2. If the condition fails, an error message is printed and module operation is disabled.
- **General Readability and Practices**: Commenting has been improved, and the code maintains a clean structure.

This implementation ensures that the module is robust and adheres to common design principles in hardware description languages.
