The Verilog code you've provided has a few issues that need correction to ensure it functions correctly:

1. **Logical Error in Default Case**: The logic to assign the position (`pos`) in the `default` case can lead to unintended behavior. If no bits are high, `pos` will still be set to the last high bit detected, which would not be desirable.

2. **Using `always @(*)` Block Need for Begin-End**: Although not a direct error, it is better to use a `begin`-`end` block within an `always` construct for clarity, especially when comprising multiple actions.

3. **Using Default Assignment**: The `pos` should be set to a default value at the start and then updated in the `case` or conditional statements.

Here is the corrected version of the module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [2:0] pos );

    always @(*) begin
        pos = 3'bxxx; // Default to unknown value if no bits are high
        
        // Check for each position in descending order 
        // (from MSB to LSB) to prioritize finding the highest bit.
        if (in[7]) pos = 3'd7;
        else if (in[6]) pos = 3'd6;
        else if (in[5]) pos = 3'd5;
        else if (in[4]) pos = 3'd4;
        else if (in[3]) pos = 3'd3;
        else if (in[2]) pos = 3'd2;
        else if (in[1]) pos = 3'd1;
        else if (in[0]) pos = 3'd0;
        // If no bits are high, pos should remain unchanged (3'bxxx is used as a default)
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Corrections:
1. The default value for `pos` is set to an undefined state (`3'bxxx`), representing the case where no input bit is high.
2. The code now sequentially checks the bits from the most significant (MSB) to least significant (LSB), ensuring that if multiple bits are set, the highest index is selected.
3. The structure is clearer, and priorities are more comprehensive, adhering to best practices in hardware design using Verilog.
