The provided Verilog code does not have any syntax errors and it functions as intended to compare two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`, assigning `z` to high (`1'b1`) if they are equal and low (`1'b0`) if they are not.

However, to adhere to best practices and enhance code readability, we can make a few improvements:

1. Use meaningful comments to describe what the module does.
2. Explicitly define the sensitivity for the outputs. (In combinational logic, it is common to use assign statements, which are inherently combinational, but clarifying the context can be helpful.)
3. Use the `logic` data type from SystemVerilog if we're willing to use it as it provides better simulation behavior.

Below is a refined version of the original code compiled under best practices:

```verilog
// This module compares two 2-bit input values A and B and outputs z.
module top_module (
    input [1:0] A,  // 2-bit input A
    input [1:0] B,  // 2-bit input B
    output z        // Output indicating if A is equal to B
); 
    assign z = (A == B); // Assign z to 1 if A equals B, otherwise 0
endmodule
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added comments for clarity.
- Simplified the assignment `z` directly from the comparison, which makes the code cleaner and more readable since the expression `(A == B)` will evaluate to either `1'b1` for true or `1'b0` for false. 

These changes make the module maintainable while ensuring that it follows good coding practices.
