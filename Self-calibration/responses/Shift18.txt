The given Verilog module has a few logical issues. Let's review and correct them:

1. **Arithmetic Right Shift by 8 Bits**: In the case `amount = 2'b11`, the arithmetic right shift by 8 bits should properly extend the sign bit (`q[63]`). The current implementation extends the sign bit for 8 bits but incorrectly shifts less than 56 bits into `q`.

2. **Default Case**: While having a `default` case like `q <= q;` prevents latches, itâ€™s technically redundant here as all cases have been considered and would not create a latch.

3. **Sign-extension in Shifting**: The arithmetic right shift requires ensuring that sign-extension is correctly applied when shifting right.

Corrected version of the Verilog code:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input ena,
    input [1:0] amount,
    input [63:0] data,
    output reg [63:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            case (amount)
                2'b00: q <= q << 1; // Shift left by 1 bit
                2'b01: q <= q << 8; // Shift left by 8 bits
                2'b10: q <= {q[63], q[63:1]}; // Arithmetic shift right by 1 bit
                2'b11: q <= {{8{q[63]}}, q[63:8]}; // Arithmetic shift right by 8 bits
                // No `default` case needed if all cases are covered and no synthesis of latches
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

**Corrections Made:**
- The arithmetic right shift for `amount = 2'b11` has been checked to ensure that sign extension is consistently handled in 64-bit width.
- The `default` case is implicit since all cases for `amount` are adequately handled due to the exhaustive nature of the `case` statement and no additional case is logically required. 

This module now follows clean design practices, ensuring correct functionality aligned with your intended behavior.
