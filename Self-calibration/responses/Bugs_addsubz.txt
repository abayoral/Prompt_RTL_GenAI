The provided Verilog module appears to be mostly correct, but there are a few improvements that can be made to ensure better coding practices and security:

1. **Use of Proper Binary Literal**: The binary literal `8'b00000000` can be simplified to `8'b0`, which is easier to read and understand.

2. **Cleaner Conditional Assignment**: The expression `(out == 8'b0) ? 1 : 0;` can be simplified to `(out == 8'b0);` as it directly yields a boolean result which is compatible with an integer logic assignment in Verilog.

3. **Removing Unnecessary Assignments**: Though the current implementation is correct, certain practices such as typecasting the boolean check directly to the `result_is_zero` variable inherently improve readability.

Here's the improved version of the module:

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module ( 
    input do_sub,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out,
    output reg result_is_zero
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (do_sub)
            out = a - b;  // If do_sub is 1, subtract
        else
            out = a + b;  // If do_sub is 0, add
            
        // Check if the result is zero
        result_is_zero = (out == 8'b0);
    end

endmodule
```

These changes contribute to improved readability and clarity, but in terms of functionality, the original behavior is preserved.
