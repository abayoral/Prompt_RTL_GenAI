The provided Verilog module appears to function as a traffic light controller. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `typedef` for the state machine is using `logic`, which is not supported in standard Verilog (it's SystemVerilog). We can handle this by using `reg` for states.

2. The variable `cnt` is both read and assigned in the same block without proper transition logic, particularly in the combinational logic block where the next state is determined (`always @(*)`). Assigning `cnt` directly here can create glitches because this should happen in the sequential logic block only.

3. The `next_state` assignment in each case should make sure `cnt` values are correctly updated only in the sequential block.

4. When `pass_request` is high and green should be shortened, `cnt` should be decremented every cycle instead of being set to a fixed value of 8'd10 in the combinational logic.

5. Need to protect state transitions using default state and counter initialization to cover all cases.

Let's provide a corrected version of the module:

```verilog
module traffic_light (
    input  wire       clk,
    input  wire       rst_n,
    input  wire       pass_request,
    output reg [7:0]  clock,
    output reg        red,
    output reg        yellow,
    output reg        green
);

    // Define states
    localparam s1_red    = 2'b00,
               s2_yellow = 2'b01,
               s3_green  = 2'b10;

    reg [1:0] state, next_state;
    reg [7:0] cnt, next_cnt;
  
    // Define state and counter combination logic
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            state <= s1_red;
            cnt <= 8'd10; // Initial red state duration
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
            cnt <= next_cnt;
        end
    end

    // Define state transition logic
    always @(*) begin
        next_state = state; // Default to current state
        next_cnt = cnt - 8'd1; // Default behavior to decrement count
        case (state)
            s1_red: begin
                if (cnt == 0) begin
                    next_state = s3_green;
                    next_cnt = 8'd60; // Green phase duration
                end
            end

            s2_yellow: begin
                if (cnt == 0) begin
                    next_state = s1_red;
                    next_cnt = 8'd10; // Red phase duration
                end
            end

            s3_green: begin
                if (pass_request && cnt > 8'd10) begin
                    next_cnt = 8'd10; // Shorten green phase to 10 cycles
                end else if (cnt == 0) begin
                    next_state = s2_yellow;
                    next_cnt = 8'd5; // Yellow phase duration
                end
            end
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic
    always @(*) begin
        // Default outputs
        red = 0;
        yellow = 0;
        green = 0;

        case (state)
            s1_red: begin
                red = 1;
            end

            s2_yellow: begin
                yellow = 1;
            end

            s3_green: begin
                green = 1;
            end
        endcase
        
        clock = cnt;
    end
endmodule
```

In the corrected code:
- State assignments are properly handled.
- Counter logic is managed in both the sequential and combinational logic blocks.
- The code now uses classical Verilog construct (`localparam`, `reg`), removing the unsupported `typedef` and `enum logic`.
