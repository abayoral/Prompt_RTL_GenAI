The given Verilog code for an 8-bit multiplier appears mostly correct but can be improved for clarity and security. There are no major logical or syntax errors, but I'll highlight some best practices and potential improvements you might consider:

1. **Use of `integer` for loop variable**: While defining `i` as an `integer` is correct, it's often clearer and preferable for static analysis tools if loop variables are defined as `int` in SystemVerilog or as `reg` in Verilog.

2. **Unnecessary use of `reg` type in outputs**: In a combinational block defined by `always @(*)`, output variables do not necessarily have to be declared as `reg`, but in Verilog, `reg` is used for any variable that retains value across procedural blocks, which in this case is fine.

3. **Ensure initialization**: The product is initialized correctly within the `always @(*)` block, but it's also good practice to ensure all combination logic initializes values to prevent unintended latches.

4. **Conform to additional best practices**: The Verilog provided is not vulnerable to any specific security issues for this scale, but ensure your toolchain and simulation environment are up-to-date with security patches.

Here's a minor revision with some comments added:

```verilog
module multi_8bit (
    input  [7:0] A,
    input  [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] product
);

integer i; // Declare loop variable

always @(*) begin
    product = 16'b0; // Initialize product to zero, avoid any latches
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
        if (B[i]) begin
            product = product + (A << i); // Shift and add for the multiply
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

But overall, your original code is functionally correct for performing an 8-bit multiplication. The above suggestions are mainly stylistic and intended to promote best practices in code clarity and maintenance. If you're looking into transitioning towards SystemVerilog, you could consider migrating variables and data types accordingly for better practices.
