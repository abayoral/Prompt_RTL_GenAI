The provided Verilog code generally appears syntactically correct, but there are a couple of things to check and potentially correct related to functionality and best practices. The primary problem is the lack of any actual logic inside the `mod_a` module. Without it, the module does not perform any meaningful operations. Here's a revised version that includes some dummy logic for `mod_a`. 

If the main function of `mod_a` was not provided, I'll demonstrate some placeholder logic for clarity.

```verilog
module mod_a (
    output reg out1, 
    output reg out2, 
    input in1, 
    input in2, 
    input in3, 
    input in4
);
    // Example logic for demonstration purposes
    always @(*) begin
        out1 = in1 & in2; // Logical AND between in1 and in2
        out2 = in3 | in4; // Logical OR between in3 and in4
    end

endmodule

module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

    // Instantiating mod_a and connecting the top_module ports by name
    mod_a mod_a_instance (
        .out1(out1), 
        .out2(out2), 
        .in1(a), 
        .in2(b), 
        .in3(c), 
        .in4(d)
    );

endmodule
```

### Key Points:

1. **Logic Implementation:** Actual logic has been introduced into the `mod_a` module to give it a sample functionality. The logic should be adjusted based on the intended functionality of the module.
  
2. **Output Declaration:** The `out1` and `out2` signals inside the `mod_a` module were changed to `reg` type because they are assigned a value within an `always` block, which requires them to be of type `reg`.

3. **Sensitivity List (`always @(*)`):** The use of `always @(*)` is a Verilog best practice for combinational logic, as it automatically includes all inputs to the block and avoids potential latches or unexpected behaviors.

Make sure to adapt the logic (currently simple AND/OR operations) according to your specific project's requirements.
