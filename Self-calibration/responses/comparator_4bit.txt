The provided Verilog module is a 4-bit comparator that attempts to determine if one 4-bit input (`A`) is greater than, equal to, or less than another 4-bit input (`B`). Let's review and correct any issues in the code. 

### Issues Identified:
1. **Subtraction for Comparison**: The logic for determining if `A` is greater, equal, or less than `B` seems mostly correct but could be simplified or clarified.
2. **Borrow Bit Interpretation**: The borrow bit determines whether `A` is less than `B` in unsigned subtraction. However, the current usage needs verification in this context.
3. **Redundant Conditions**: The condition for `A_equal` can be simplified since it should logically align with `A - B` resulting in zero without needing a separate `==` check.

### Corrections & Best Practices:
1. **Logical Expressions**: Simplify the logic used for determining when `A` is greater or equal.
2. **Clean Code**: Ensure logic directly reflects functionality.

Here's the revised code:

```verilog
module comparator_4bit (
    input [3:0] A,
    input [3:0] B,
    output A_greater,
    output A_equal,
    output A_less
);
    // Use subtraction to derive comparison. Equivalent to direct comparison.
    wire [4:0] diff = {1'b0, A} - {1'b0, B}; // Extending to 5 bits to observe borrow

    // Assign outputs based on diff
    assign A_greater = diff[4] == 0 && diff[3:0] != 0; // No borrow and non-zero difference
    assign A_equal = diff[3:0] == 0;                   // Result is zero indicating equality
    assign A_less = diff[4] == 1;                      // Borrow indicates A < B

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Sign Extension**: The subtraction `diff` includes a higher-order bit (5th bit `diff[4]`) to correctly capture a borrow condition when `A` is less than `B`.
- **Comparisons**: 
  - `A_greater`: Checks for no borrow and non-zero `diff`.
  - `A_equal`: Simply checks if `diff` in lower 4-bits is zero.
  - `A_less`: Checks if the borrow bit `diff[4]` is set.
- This logic ensures the correct determination of comparison outputs based on standard unsigned binary arithmetic.
