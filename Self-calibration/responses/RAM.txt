The given Verilog code for a dual-port RAM module is mostly correct, but there are a few minor improvements and corrections that can be made. The primary functionality and structure are sound; however, let's address potential enhancements:

1. **Asynchronous Reset Initialization of RAM**: When using an asynchronous reset for the RAM, it is typical to handle it in a separate reset block, but this approach is acceptable since you intend to clear the memory. However, ensure the synthesis tool properly understands the intention.

2. **Synthesis Tool Directives**: It might be better to place synthesis-specific directives for memory initialization, but this is optional and depends on your synthesis tool.

3. **Read Enable Handling**: Currently, if `read_en` is low, the output `read_data` will retain its previous value which is usually expected behavior for RAM. It's important to confirm this is your intended behavior. If not, you may need to determine what value `read_data` should have when `read_en` is deasserted.

4. **Prevent Write and Read at the Same Address**: Hardware implementations of RAM can have issues if the same address is read and written in the same cycle. Currently, there is no protection against this.

Considering these points, let's provide an improved version of the module:

```verilog
module dual_port_ram #(
    parameter WIDTH = 6,
    parameter DEPTH = 8,
    parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 3
)(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire write_en,
    input wire [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] write_addr,
    input wire [WIDTH-1:0] write_data,
    input wire read_en,
    input wire [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] read_addr,
    output reg [WIDTH-1:0] read_data
);

    // Memory array declaration
    reg [WIDTH-1:0] ram [DEPTH-1:0];

    integer i;

    // Asynchronous Reset and Write operation
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            // Reset all memory locations to zero
            for (i = 0; i < DEPTH; i = i + 1) begin
                ram[i] <= {WIDTH{1'b0}};
            end
        end else if (write_en) begin
            // Handle the case if the address being written is the same as read_addr (ignore for simplicity)
            ram[write_addr] <= write_data;
        end
    end

    // Synchronous Read operation
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (read_en) begin
            read_data <= ram[read_addr];
        end
        // Optionally, specify behavior if `read_en` is low
        // else begin
        //     read_data <= {WIDTH{1'b0}}; // Example reset to 0 when not reading
        // end
    end

endmodule
```

- **Note**: The case where `write_addr` and `read_addr` refer to the same location and `write_en` and `read_en` are both active in the same clock cycle is typically handled by prioritizing write or having undefined behavior. If necessary, you should define how it ought to be resolved explicitly based on your architecture or requirements. The current implementation doesn't include explicit logic for this and assumes this is not a possible case or that the behavior is acceptable as is.

- Always simulate the design thoroughly to ensure it meets your intended design criteria.
