The provided Verilog code for the `instr_reg` module has a few logical and syntactical aspects that can be improved. Let's review and correct them:

1. **Reset Behavior**: 
   - The reset signal is described as active-low, however, the usage of negedge in the `always` block may not be the best choice for clarity with active low signals. It is more common to use posedge for simplicity and to use an internal active high reset.

2. **Fetch Control Logic**:
   - The fetch signals should be mutually exclusive, meaning care should be taken to not have overlapping fetch states unless explicitly allowed or defined.

3. **Default State**:
   - The default case should not include re-assigning values from themselves unless necessary, as this is effectively a no-operation.

4. **Output conditional behavior**:
   - It's good practice to use non-blocking assignments consistently in sequential logic and avoid combinational logic that depends on latches or uninitialized signals.

Here's the corrected version with comments explaining the modifications:

```verilog
module instr_reg (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,          // Active low reset signal, renamed for clarity
    input wire [1:0] fetch,    // Fetch control signal
    input wire [7:0] data,     // Data input
    
    output reg [2:0] ins,      // Opcode output
    output reg [4:0] ad1,      // Register address output
    output reg [7:0] ad2       // Full instruction output (when fetched from second source)
);

    reg [7:0] ins_p1;  // Register for first source
    reg [7:0] ins_p2;  // Register for second source

    // Always block with posedge clock for simple, clear logic
    // Clear registers on reset

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            // Initialize registers to zero on active low reset
            ins_p1 <= 8'b0;
            ins_p2 <= 8'b0;
        end else begin
            case (fetch)
                2'b01: ins_p1 <= data; // Fetching from data to ins_p1
                2'b10: ins_p2 <= data; // Fetching from data to ins_p2
                // For mutually exclusive fetch, there's no need for default case
            endcase
        end
    end

    // Continually assign outputs based on current instruction sources
    always @(*) begin
        ins = ins_p1[7:5];   // High 3 bits (Opcode)
        ad1 = ins_p1[4:0];   // Low 5 bits (Register address)
        ad2 = ins_p2;        // Full 8-bit instruction from ins_p2
    end
endmodule
```

**Summary of Changes**:
- Changed `rst` to `rst_n` to denote active low.
- Used `posedge clk` in the `always` block for clarity.
- Simplified the default case in the `case` statement.
- Provided clear division between sequential and combinational blocks for better readability and functionality.
