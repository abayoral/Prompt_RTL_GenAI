The provided Verilog module has a few issues and potential improvements:

1. **Potential Overflow/Underflow**: The operation `a * b` results in a 64-bit product when both `a` and `b` are 32-bit values. However, this 64-bit result is being stored into a 32-bit register `c`. This could lead to overflow if not handled properly.

2. **Accumulator Size**: Given that `c` continuously accumulates the product of `a` and `b`, it might be prudent to consider extending its size to accommodate larger values or providing a mechanism to handle overflow.

3. **Initial Value**: It's a good practice to initialize registers, although `c` is reset by `rst`, which is good, but adding an initial condition can help avoid simulation issues.

4. **Comments for Clarity**: Code comments should be clear and accurate.

Below is the corrected and improved version of the Verilog module:

```verilog
module pe (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    input wire [31:0] a,
    input wire [31:0] b,
    output reg [63:0] c  // Expanding c to 64-bits for handling full result of multiplication
);

    // Use initial block for simulation purposes only to ensure c starts at a known state
    initial begin
        c = 64'b0;
    end

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            c <= 64'b0; // Reset the accumulator to zero when rst is high
        end else begin
            c <= c + (a * b); // Multiply a and b and add to the accumulator
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Notes:
- **Output Register Size**: Changed `c` to a 64-bit register to handle the full result of the multiplication `a * b`.
- **Initialization**: Included an initial block for simulation purposes to set `c` to zero before the first reset.
- **Overflow Management**: Ensure your system handles potential overflow situations, such as integrating overflow detection or setting warnings during simulation to signal when overflows happen.
