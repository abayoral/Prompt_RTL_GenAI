The provided Verilog code for the module is mostly correct, but it contains a minor stylistic issue. Input and output ports are intermixed without grouping them separately, which can make the code harder to read and maintain. Additionally, good practice is to clearly separate the declaration of inputs and outputs. Here's a revised version:

```verilog
module top_module (
    // Inputs
    input p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    
    // Outputs
    output p1y,
    output p2y
);

    // Implementing two 4-input NAND gates
    assign p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);
    assign p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);

endmodule
```

### Key Points:

1. **Grouping of Inputs and Outputs**: Inputs and outputs are grouped separately for better readability, which is a best practice.

2. **Code Formatting**: Maintaining a clear and consistent format makes it easier to read and understand the module's functionality.

Your original logic and syntax were correct; only minor stylistic adjustments were suggested for clarity and maintainability.
