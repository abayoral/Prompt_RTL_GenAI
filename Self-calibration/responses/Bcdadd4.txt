The provided Verilog code implements a BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) adder using a ripple-carry adder structure with four BCD adder instances. However, there are a few issues and improvements that can be addressed to ensure the code is functionally correct and adheres to best practices. Let's review and correct these issues:

1. **Remove Combinational Logic from 'always' block with non-blocking assignment**: Non-blocking assignments should be avoided in combinational logic, and the `always` block should be used with a sensitivity list `(*)`. However, since we're performing a simple addition followed by a conditional check, itâ€™s best to do this in an `always_comb` block (SystemVerilog) or directly as concurrent assignments.

2. **Adjust overflow logic in BCD addition**: The overflow logic inside the `bcd_fadd` should be handled concurrently and it needs correction (if using `always`, ensure it fits the pattern). This is critical for BCD operations where sums greater than 9 need adjustments.

3. **Initial Value for `internal_sum`**: Ensure that `internal_sum` is initialized to prevent latches. Although the nature of the logic doesn't require initialization, let's make sure it's part of the combination logic correctly to avoid unintended latching.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```verilog
module bcd_fadd (
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input cin,
    output reg cout,
    output reg [3:0] sum
);

    reg [4:0] internal_sum;

    always @(*) begin
        internal_sum = a + b + cin;
        if (internal_sum > 9) begin
            internal_sum = internal_sum + 4'd6; // Correct for BCD overflow
        end
        sum = internal_sum[3:0];
        cout = internal_sum[4];
    end
endmodule

module top_module (
    input [15:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output cout,
    output [15:0] sum
);

    wire [2:0] carry; // Only 3 intermediate carries are needed

    bcd_fadd u0 (
        .a(a[3:0]),
        .b(b[3:0]),
        .cin(cin),
        .sum(sum[3:0]),
        .cout(carry[0])
    );

    bcd_fadd u1 (
        .a(a[7:4]),
        .b(b[7:4]),
        .cin(carry[0]),
        .sum(sum[7:4]),
        .cout(carry[1])
    );

    bcd_fadd u2 (
        .a(a[11:8]),
        .b(b[11:8]),
        .cin(carry[1]),
        .sum(sum[11:8]),
        .cout(carry[2])
    );

    bcd_fadd u3 (
        .a(a[15:12]),
        .b(b[15:12]),
        .cin(carry[2]),
        .sum(sum[15:12]),
        .cout(cout)
    );

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`internal_sum` Calculation:** The use of `internal_sum` has been preserved with a concurrent conditional check for BCD correction.
- **Internal Net for Carries:** We correctly handle the carry signals between BCD adder instances on the width of `carry` to match the required interconnects.
- **`always @(*)` Block:** Correctly utilized to ensure that all driving logic of `internal_sum`, `cout`, and `sum` is appropriately synchronized with changes in inputs, preventing potential latch inference.
- **Code Readability:** The fixed-size `reg [4:0] internal_sum;` ensures clarity on internal operations and explicit handling of the carry bit.

This version should work correctly for 16-bit BCD addition, managing carries properly between 4-bit BCD blocks.
