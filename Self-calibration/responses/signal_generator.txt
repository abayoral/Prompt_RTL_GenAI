The provided Verilog code for the `signal_generator` module generally looks correct. However, I'll review it for potential improvements in readability and practices. Here's the revised version with explanations:

```verilog
module signal_generator (
    input wire clk,      // Explicitly specify wire for input ports for clarity
    input wire rst_n,
    output reg [4:0] wave
);

    reg state; // 0 for incrementing, 1 for decrementing

    // Improved sensitivity list: The original list is correct since it uses posedge and negedge as intended. No changes needed in this part.
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            // Reset conditions
            wave <= 5'd0;   // Initialize wave to 0 on reset
            state <= 1'b0;  // Initialize state to increment mode
        end else begin
            case (state)
                1'b0: begin
                    // Increment mode
                    if (wave == 5'd31) begin
                        // Switch to decrement mode
                        state <= 1'b1;
                    end else begin
                        // Increment wave
                        wave <= wave + 5'd1;  // Use 5'd1 for clarity and consistency
                    end
                end
                1'b1: begin
                    // Decrement mode
                    if (wave == 5'd0) begin
                        // Switch to increment mode
                        state <= 1'b0;
                    end else begin
                        // Decrement wave
                        wave <= wave - 5'd1;  // Use 5'd1 for clarity and consistency
                    end
                end
                default: state <= 1'b0; // Additional case for completeness and safety
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Points and Improvements:
1. **Port Declarations Explicitly as `wire`:** The input ports are inherently wires, but specifying them can improve readability and consistency.

2. **Arithmetic Operations:** In the arithmetic operations (`wave <= wave + 1;` and `wave <= wave - 1;`), although it's syntactically correct without specifying bit width, I've added `5'd1` to make it more explicit that we're dealing with 5-bit arithmetic, which can improve readability.

3. **Default Case in State Machine:** Added a `default` case to the `case` statement to handle unexpected states. This change ensures that the logic is safer and helps in debugging by covering all potential cases even if unexpected behavior occurs or in case another value mistakenly gets assigned to `state`.

These changes ensure the code is clear, robust, and adheres to best practices. The design intent is maintained: smoothly transitioning between incrementing and decrementing the `wave` signal while resetting on `rst_n`.
