Certainly! Let's follow the chain of thought to design a D flip-flop in Verilog:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - The D flip-flop should capture the value of the input \( d \) on the rising edge of the clock \( clk \) and hold this value until the next rising edge.
   - Inputs: \( clk \), \( d \)
   - Outputs: \( q \)

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: \( clk \) (clock signal), \( d \) (data input)
   - Outputs: \( q \) (data output)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed as the operation is straightforward and handled within the always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start the module with the declaration of inputs and outputs.
   - Use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal to implement the flip-flop's behavior.
   - Inside the always block, use a non-blocking assignment to capture the input \( d \) and assign it to the output \( q \).

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,    // Clock signal
    input d,      // Data input
    output reg q  // Data output
);

    // Flip-flop logic: Capture d at the rising edge of clk
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end
    
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Declarations:**
  - `input clk`: This is the clock signal that will trigger updates to the flip-flop.
  - `input d`: This is the data input that will be captured by the flip-flop.
- **Output Declarations:**
  - `output reg q`: This is the data output that will hold the captured value of \( d \).
- **Always Block:**
  - `always @(posedge clk)`: This block is triggered on the rising edge of \( clk \).
  - `q <= d;`: Inside the always block, the input \( d \) is assigned to the output \( q \) using a non-blocking assignment.

This ensures that the output \( q \) correctly follows the input \( d \) at each positive edge of the clock signal \( clk \).
