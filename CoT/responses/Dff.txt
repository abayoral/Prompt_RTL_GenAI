To implement a single D flip-flop in Verilog, we will use an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`). The D flip-flop is a sequential logic design element that captures the value of the data input (`d`) at a clock edge and outputs it through `q` until the next clock edge. The non-blocking assignment (`<=`) is used within the always block to ensure proper synchronous behavior.

Hereâ€™s how you can structure and implement the requested module:

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - A single D flip-flop captures the input `d` at every positive edge of the clock `clk`.
   - The output `q` will hold the captured value until the next clock edge.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Inputs: `clk` (clock), `d` (data input)
   - Output: `q` (data output)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
   - No intermediate signals are necessary for a single D flip-flop.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Begin with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
   - Inside the always block, assign `d` to `q` using a non-blocking assignment.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,    // Clock input for triggering the flip-flop
    input wire d,      // Data input to be captured
    output reg q       // Output that holds the captured data
);

    // Flip-flop logic: Copy d to q at every positive edge of clk
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;  // Non-blocking assignment to capture the value of d
    end

endmodule
```

This implementation captures the essence of a D flip-flop by synchronizing the input `d` to the clock signal, ensuring reliable data storage within your sequential logic design.
