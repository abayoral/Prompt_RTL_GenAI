To instantiate the `mod_a` module within the `top_module` and connect its pins to the top-level module ports, I will follow these steps:

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Objective**: 
   - We need to instantiate an existing module `mod_a` inside our `top_module` and connect the module's ports to specific wires in the top-level module.
   - The top-level inputs are `a` and `b`, and the output is `out`.
   
2. **Identify the Connection Points**: 
   - `mod_a` has pins `in1`, `in2`, and `out`.
   - We need to connect `a` from `top_module` to `in1` of `mod_a`.
   - Connect `b` from `top_module` to `in2` of `mod_a`.
   - Connect `out` from `mod_a` to `out` in `top_module`.

3. **Instantiate `mod_a`**:
   - Use the Verilog instantiation syntax to create an instance of `mod_a`.
   - Connect each of the wires (`a`, `b`, `out`) in `top_module` to the corresponding ports in `mod_a`.

4. **Writing the Verilog Code**: 
   - Declare the `mod_a` instance and make the connections using the named port mapping technique for clarity and correctness.

Here is the Verilog code implementing the solution:

```verilog
module top_module (input a, input b, output out);
    // Instantiate mod_a and connect ports to top-level module
    mod_a instance_mod_a (
        .in1(a),
        .in2(b),
        .out(out)
    );
endmodule
```

In this code, `instance_mod_a` is an instance of `mod_a`, and the connections are made explicitly using the named port mapping technique. This ensures each signal in the `top_module` is correctly connected to the corresponding pin in `mod_a`.
