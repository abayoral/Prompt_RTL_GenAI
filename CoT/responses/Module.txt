Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to instantiate a module named `mod_a` within a top-level module named `top_module`.
    - The `mod_a` module has three ports: `in1`, `in2`, and `out`.
    - We need to connect the top-level module's ports (wires `a`, `b`, and `out`) to the instance of `mod_a`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`
    - Output: `out`

3. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the top-level module declaration, specifying its inputs and outputs.
    - Instantiate `mod_a` within the `top_module`.
    - Connect the instance ports of `mod_a` to the corresponding inputs and outputs of the `top_module`.

4. **Instantiate the Mod_a Module:**
    - Create an instance of `mod_a` and map the ports appropriately.
    - `in1` of `mod_a` will be connected to `a` of `top_module`.
    - `in2` of `mod_a` will be connected to `b` of `top_module`.
    - `out` of `mod_a` will be connected to `out` of `top_module`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**
    - Write the module `top_module` with the appropriate port connections.

```verilog
module mod_a (input in1, input in2, output out);

endmodule

module top_module ( input a, input b, output out );
    // Instantiate mod_a and connect its ports to top_module's ports
    mod_a instance_name (
        .in1(a),
        .in2(b),
        .out(out)
    );
endmodule
```

- Here, `mod_a` is instantiated within `top_module` as `instance_name`.
- The ports of the instantiated `mod_a` are connected to the corresponding ports of `top_module`.
