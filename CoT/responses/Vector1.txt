Task: Generate a Verilog module that splits an input half-word (16 bits) into lower and upper bytes.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - The input is a 16-bit half-word denoted as `in`.
    - The task is to split this input into two separate 8-bit outputs:
        - `out_hi`: the upper byte, which consists of bits [15:8].
        - `out_lo`: the lower byte, which consists of bits [7:0].

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Input: `in[15:0]` (16-bit input)
    - Outputs: 
        - `out_hi[7:0]` (upper byte output)
        - `out_lo[7:0]` (lower byte output)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are needed. The separation is straightforward and can be implemented via direct assignments.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the input and the outputs.
    - Use assign statements to separately assign the upper and lower parts of the input to their respective outputs.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
`default_nettype none

module top_module(
    input wire [15:0] in,
    output wire [7:0] out_hi,
    output wire [7:0] out_lo
);
    // Split the input: out_hi gets the upper byte, out_lo gets the lower byte
    assign out_hi = in[15:8];
    assign out_lo = in[7:0];
endmodule
```

This implementation ensures that the 16-bit input half-word is correctly divided into two 8-bit outputs, with `out_hi` representing the upper byte and `out_lo` representing the lower byte.
