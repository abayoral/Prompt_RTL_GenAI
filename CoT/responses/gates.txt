Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The task requires designing a combinational circuit to perform various logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, AND-NOT) on two input signals (a, b).
        Each output (out_and, out_or, out_xor, out_nand, out_nor, out_xnor, out_anotb) should represent the result of its respective operation.
        
    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a, b
        Outputs: out_and, out_or, out_xor, out_nand, out_nor, out_xnor, out_anotb

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed as each operation can be performed directly.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration that specifies the inputs and outputs.
        Use assign statements to define each output.
        For each output, use the corresponding operator (&, |, ^, ~&, ~|, ~^) on the inputs a and b, and for out_anotb, implement it as (a & ~b).

    Writing the Verilog Code:

verilog

module top_module ( 
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out_and,
    output wire out_or,
    output wire out_xor,
    output wire out_nand,
    output wire out_nor,
    output wire out_xnor,
    output wire out_anotb
);
    // Combine a and b using various logic operations
    assign out_and = a & b;
    assign out_or = a | b;
    assign out_xor = a ^ b;
    assign out_nand = ~(a & b);
    assign out_nor = ~(a | b);
    assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b);
    assign out_anotb = a & ~b;
endmodule
