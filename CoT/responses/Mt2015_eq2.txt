Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
   - This circuit needs to compare two 2-bit inputs (A and B) and determine if they are equal.
   - The output (z) should be 1 if both inputs are identical, otherwise 0.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
   - Inputs: A[1:0] and B[1:0]
   - Output: z

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
   - No intermediate signals are needed for this straightforward comparison, as the logic can be directly implemented using an equality operator.

4. Structuring the Module:
   - Declare the module with the specified inputs and output.
   - Use an assign statement to implement the comparator logic.
   - The equality operator (==) will be used to compare the values of A and B.
   - Assign the result of this comparison to z. If A equals B, z will be set to 1, otherwise, it will be set to 0.

5. Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [1:0] A,
    input [1:0] B,
    output wire z
);
    // Comparator logic: Set z to 1 if A equals B, else set it to 0
    assign z = (A == B);
endmodule
```

In this module, the assign statement uses the equality operator to compare the two 2-bit inputs. If they are equal, the output z is set to high (1). Otherwise, z is set to low (0). This implementation efficiently handles the task requirement of comparing two binary numbers and setting an appropriate output.
