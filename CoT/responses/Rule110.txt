To implement a Rule 110 cellular automaton with a 512-cell system, we must update the state of each cell based on itself and its two neighbors according to the given rules. The cells at the boundaries should be handled as if they have neighboring cells with state 0. 

Hereâ€™s the detailed process for developing the Verilog module:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - A 512-cell array `q` must advance one time step on each clock cycle.
   - A `load` input allows the initial state of the system to be loaded from the `data` input.
   - The state transition for each cell follows Rule 110 based on its immediate neighbors.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk`, `load`, `data[511:0]`
   - Output: `q[511:0]`

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - `q[-1]` and `q[512]` are considered 0 (off) in the boundary conditions.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - When `load` is high, load `q` with `data`.
   - Otherwise, on each rising edge of `clk`, update `q` based on Rule 110.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    integer i;
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data; // Load the input data into q when load is high
        end else begin
            // Use a temporary next_state array to store the updated states according to Rule 110
            reg [511:0] next_state;
            
            // Update each cell according to Rule 110
            for (i = 0; i < 512; i = i + 1) begin
                case ({(i == 0) ? 1'b0 : q[i-1], q[i], (i == 511) ? 1'b0 : q[i+1]})
                    3'b111: next_state[i] = 1'b0;
                    3'b110: next_state[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b101: next_state[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b100: next_state[i] = 1'b0;
                    3'b011: next_state[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b010: next_state[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b001: next_state[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b000: next_state[i] = 1'b0;
                    default: next_state[i] = 1'b0; // Default case to handle unexpected cases (should not occur)
                endcase
            end
            
            q <= next_state; // Update q to the next state
        end
    end
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- An `always` block on the rising edge of `clk` manages updates.
- If `load` is high, assign `q` with `data`.
- If `load` is low, iterate through each cell, calculate the next state using the current state and its neighbors (handling edges with 0), and update `q` at the end of the loop.
- A temporary variable `next_state` stores the intermediate result to prevent simultaneous reads and writes to `q`.
