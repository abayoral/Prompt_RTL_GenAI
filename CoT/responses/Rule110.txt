## Chain of Thought

### Understand the Requirements:
1. We need a 512-cell one-dimensional cellular automaton based on Rule 110.
2. The state of each cell is determined by itself and its two neighbours.
3. The state should update every clock cycle.
4. The system can be loaded with an initial state using the `load` signal and `data` input.
5. The boundaries (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) should be considered 0 (off).

### Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `load`: Load signal to initialize state.
  - `data`: Initial state data (512 bits).
- Output:
  - `q`: Current state of the system (512 bits).

### Define Intermediate Signals:
- We will use a register `current_state` to store the current state of the system.
- We will use a wire `next_state` to store the next state of the system.

### Structuring the Module:
1. Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
2. Implement logic to handle the `load` signal. If `load` is high, update the `current_state` with `data`.
3. Implement the Rule 110 logic to compute the `next_state` based on the current state of each cell and its neighbours.
4. Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to update the `current_state` with the `next_state`.

### Writing the Verilog Code:
```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
); 
    reg [511:0] current_state, next_state;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load)
            current_state <= data;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end
    
    integer i;
    always @(*) begin
        for (i = 0; i < 512; i = i + 1) begin
            if (i == 0) begin
                // Left boundary
                next_state[i] = (current_state[0] & current_state[1]) |
                                (current_state[1] & ~current_state[0]) |
                                (current_state[0] & ~current_state[1]);
            end else if (i == 511) begin
                // Right boundary
                next_state[i] = (current_state[511] & current_state[510]) |
                                (current_state[510] & ~current_state[511]) |
                                (current_state[511] & ~current_state[510]);
            end else begin
                // General case
                next_state[i] = (current_state[i-1] & current_state[i] & current_state[i+1]) |
                                (current_state[i-1] & ~current_state[i] & ~current_state[i+1]) |
                                (~current_state[i-1] & current_state[i] & ~current_state[i+1]) |
                                (~current_state[i-1] & current_state[i] & current_state[i+1]);
            end
        end
    end

    // Assign the current state to q
    assign q = current_state;

endmodule
```

This code implements a 512-cell cellular automaton based on Rule 110, advancing one time step for each clock cycle. The `load` signal allows the initial state to be loaded, and the boundaries are considered zero as required.
