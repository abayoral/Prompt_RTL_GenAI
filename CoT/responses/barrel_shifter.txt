To design the `barrel_shifter` module as specified, we will utilize a series of 2-to-1 multiplexers to achieve the desired bit rotation based on the 3-bit control signal. This design strategy involves leveraging stage-wise shifts where each stage corresponds to one of the control bits (`ctrl[2:0]`) and the respective positional shifts. The idea is to decompose the shifting operation so that each control bit independently determines if the shift should be applied at its respective stage.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need to create a module capable of rotating an 8-bit input by 1, 2, or 4 positions based on a 3-bit control input.
    - The control bits (`ctrl[2:0]`) determine whether to shift by 4 positions (`ctrl[2]`), 2 positions (`ctrl[1]`), and/or 1 position (`ctrl[0]`).

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `in[7:0]`, `ctrl[2:0]`
    - Outputs: `out[7:0]`

3. **Plan the Structure**:
    - Use a layered approach where each layer determines shifting based on a single bit from `ctrl`.
    - Implement a combination of shifts using multiplexers:
      - First, check `ctrl[2]` for a shift by 4 positions.
      - Then, check `ctrl[1]` for a 2-position adjustment.
      - Finally, apply `ctrl[0]` for a 1-position adjustment.

4. **Use Multiplexers for Selection**:
    - A `mux2X1` can be modeled simply with a ternary operator to select between two input options based on control signals.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

Here is the complete Verilog code for the `barrel_shifter` module:

```verilog
module barrel_shifter (
    input wire [7:0] in,
    input wire [2:0] ctrl,
    output wire [7:0] out
);
    wire [7:0] stage1, stage2, stage3;

    // Stage 1: Shift by 4 bits if ctrl[2] is high
    assign stage1 = ctrl[2] ? {in[3:0], in[7:4]} : in;
    
    // Stage 2: Shift by 2 bits if ctrl[1] is high
    assign stage2 = ctrl[1] ? {stage1[5:0], stage1[7:6]} : stage1;
    
    // Stage 3: Shift by 1 bit if ctrl[0] is high
    assign stage3 = ctrl[0] ? {stage2[6:0], stage2[7]} : stage2;
    
    // Output
    assign out = stage3;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Stage 1** (`ctrl[2]`): If the bit `ctrl[2]` is 1, the input vector `in` undergoes a logical right rotation by 4 bits, otherwise, it proceeds without change.
- **Stage 2** (`ctrl[1]`): This conditionally applies a shift by 2 bits using the result from Stage 1.
- **Stage 3** (`ctrl[0]`): Finally, based on the last control bit, a shift by 1 bit is applied.
- **Output Assignment**: The final staged vector is assigned to the output `out`.

This structured approach efficiently exploits the layered shifting concept and the bit-wise control of the barrel shifter operation using multiplexers.
