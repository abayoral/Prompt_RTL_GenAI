To address the given task, we need to create a top-level module that combines three instances of the provided `my_dff8` module to form an 8-bit wide shift register of length 3. Additionally, we will implement a 4-to-1 multiplexer that selects between the input `d`, and the outputs after one, two, or three clock cycles based on the 2-bit select signal `sel`.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Instantiate the D Flip-Flops:** 
   - Create three instances of the `my_dff8` module and chain them together. This means the output of one instance will be fed as the input to the next instance.

2. **Implement the 4-to-1 Multiplexer:**
   - Use an always block with a case statement to implement the multiplexer. This multiplexer will use the `sel` input to select between the input `d` and the outputs from each stage of the D flip-flops.

3. **Outputs:**
   - The module should output the selected value based on `sel`.

Here's the Verilog code implementing the above logic:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    input [1:0] sel,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    // Intermediate signals to connect D flip-flop stages
    wire [7:0] q1, q2, q3;

    // Instantiate three my_dff8 modules to form a shift register
    my_dff8 stage1 (
        .clk(clk),
        .d(d),
        .q(q1)
    );

    my_dff8 stage2 (
        .clk(clk),
        .d(q1),
        .q(q2)
    );

    my_dff8 stage3 (
        .clk(clk),
        .d(q2),
        .q(q3)
    );

    // 4-to-1 multiplexer logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            2'b00: q = d;   // Output the input directly
            2'b01: q = q1;  // Output after first D flip-flop stage
            2'b10: q = q2;  // Output after second D flip-flop stage
            2'b11: q = q3;  // Output after third D flip-flop stage
            default: q = 8'b0; // Default case; ideally not needed
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **D Flip-Flop Chaining:** The flip-flops are staked such that `stage1` captures `d`, `stage2` takes input from `q1`, and `stage3` takes input from `q2`, forming a shift register.
- **Multiplexer Logic:** The case statement in the always block decides the output `q` based on the `sel` signal:
  - `sel = 00`: Output the direct input `d`.
  - `sel = 01`: Output the result after the first stage (`q1`).
  - `sel = 10`: Output the result after the second stage (`q2`).
  - `sel = 11`: Output the result after the third stage (`q3`).

This implementation achieves the required shift register and multiplexing functionality with the specified behavior.
