### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to create a top-level module that chains three 8-bit D flip-flop modules (my_dff8) to form an 8-bit wide shift register of length 3.
    - Additionally, we need a 4-to-1 multiplexer to select one of four possible 8-bit outputs based on the `sel` signal. The outputs represent the value after 0, 1, 2, or 3 clock cycles (delays).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: 
        - `clk` (clock signal)
        - `d` (8-bit data input)
        - `sel` (2-bit select signal)
    - Output:
        - `q` (8-bit data output)

3. **Define the Intermediate Signals:**
    - We will use intermediate signals to hold the outputs of the chained D flip-flops:
        - `q1` (output after the first D flip-flop)
        - `q2` (output after the second D flip-flop)
        - `q3` (output after the third D flip-flop)

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Instantiate three instances of `my_dff8` and chain their outputs to form the shift register.
    - Implement a 4-to-1 multiplexer using an always block with a case statement to select the appropriate output based on the `sel` signal.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**
    - The `top_module` will include the instantiation of the `my_dff8` modules and the multiplexer logic.

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
// Provided module my_dff8
module my_dff8 (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end
endmodule

// Top-level module
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    input [1:0] sel,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    // Intermediate signals for the outputs of the D flip-flops
    wire [7:0] q1, q2, q3;

    // Instantiate three my_dff8 modules and chain them
    my_dff8 dff1 (.clk(clk), .d(d), .q(q1));
    my_dff8 dff2 (.clk(clk), .d(q1), .q(q2));
    my_dff8 dff3 (.clk(clk), .d(q2), .q(q3));

    // 4-to-1 Multiplexer to select the output based on sel
    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            2'b00: q = d;
            2'b01: q = q1;
            2'b02: q = q2;
            2'b03: q = q3;
            default: q = 8'b0; // Default case, although unnecessary as sel can only be 2-bit
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- Three instances of `my_dff8` are chained together to form the shift register.
- The output of each stage (q1, q2, q3) is wired to the input of the next stage.
- The 4-to-1 multiplexer is implemented within an always block that uses a case statement to select the output based on the value of `sel`. The possible 8-bit outputs correspond to the input after 0, 1, 2, or 3 clock cycles.
