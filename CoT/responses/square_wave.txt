To implement a square wave signal generator with adjustable frequency characteristics based on the provided specifications, let's analyze the design and transform it into a Verilog module. The module will feature the specified input and output ports, and incorporate a counter to determine the toggling intervals of the square wave output.

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - A square wave generator outputs a signal that toggles between high and low states at a frequency determined by the `freq` input.
   - The `clk` input serves as the timing reference for the module.
   - The `freq` input, an 8-bit vector, specifies how many clock cycles should pass before toggling the output signal.
   - The `wave_out` output delivers the square wave signal.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `freq` (8-bit frequency control signal).
   - Output: `wave_out` (square wave output signal).

3. **Define Internal Registers:**
   - `count` (8-bit): A counter used to track the number of clock cycles elapsed.
   - `wave_out` (reg type since it gets updated in the always block): The square wave signal that toggles based on the counter.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Begin with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Implement an `always` block sensitive to the rising edge of the `clk`.
   - Inside the `always` block, increment the `count` on each clock cycle.
   - When `count` reaches `freq - 1`, toggle the `wave_out` signal and reset the `count`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module square_wave (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] freq,
    output reg wave_out
);
    // Internal register for counting clock cycles
    reg [7:0] count;

    // Main logic: Generate square wave based on frequency control
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (count == freq - 1) begin
            wave_out <= ~wave_out;  // Toggle the wave_out signal
            count <= 8'b0;          // Reset count
        end else begin
            count <= count + 1;     // Increment count
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Counter Logic:** The `count` register increments on each clock rising edge.
- **Toggling Condition:** When `count` reaches `freq - 1`, `wave_out` toggles, and `count` resets to zero. This effectively controls the frequency of the `wave_out` signal.
- **Frequency Control:** The `freq` value sets the cycle count needed before toggling, allowing the output frequency to adjust based on this input.

This design ensures the `square_wave` module behaves as specified, toggling the `wave_out` signal based on the `freq` value, and using the `clk` as the timing source.
