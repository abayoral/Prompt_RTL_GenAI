To create a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with specified tap positions (32, 22, 2, and 1), we need to understand the working of a Galois LFSR and how taps influence the feedback mechanism.

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the LFSR Requirements**:
   - A Galois LFSR shifts its contents one bit position to the right on each clock edge. The tap positions determine where the feedback occurs. 
   - For a 32-bit LFSR, feedback is applied to the least significant bit (bit 0) using an XOR of the current bits at the tap positions (32, 22, 2, and 1).

2. **Synchronous Reset**:
   - The LFSR will be synchronously reset to the value `32'h1` on a high reset signal.

3. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Inputs: `clk`, `reset`
   - Output: `q[31:0]`

4. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
   - We will use a temporary 32-bit register to hold the LFSR state.

5. **Coding the Galois LFSR**:
   - In the always block, triggered on the rising edge of the clock:
     - If reset is high, set the LFSR to `32'h1`.
     - Otherwise, shift the LFSR and apply feedback to the least significant bit through XOR operations with the tap positions.

6. **Writing the Verilog Code**:  
   - Use an always block to manage the clocked operations, handle the reset, and implement the LFSR shift and feedback logic.

### Verilog Code:
```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input reset,  // Active-high synchronous reset to 32'h1
    output reg [31:0] q
);

    wire feedback;

    // Feedback signal is the XOR of tap positions
    assign feedback = q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0];

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 32'h1;  // Reset state
        else
            q <= {q[30:0], feedback};  // Shift and insert feedback at LSB
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Feedback Calculation**: The XOR of the bits at positions 32 (31 in 0-based index), 22 (21), 2 (1), and 1 (0) is calculated as the `feedback` signal.
- **Shift Operation**: In the absence of a reset, the LFSR shifts by concatenating the upper 31 bits with the `feedback` bit at the LSB position.
- **Reset Condition**: When the reset is high, the LFSR state is initialized to `32'h1`.

This implementation efficiently uses vector operations rather than instantiating individual flip-flops, aligning with modern Verilog practices for handling such logic designs.
