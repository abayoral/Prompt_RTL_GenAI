Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - A 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is needed.
    - The LFSR should have taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1.
    - It should support an active-high synchronous reset that sets the output to `32'h1`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `clk`, `reset`
    - Outputs: `q[31:0]`
    
3. **Identify Intermediate Signals:**
    - The taps will be used to create a feedback mechanism for the LFSR.
    - The feedback bit is derived from the selected tap positions and will be used to shift into the LFSR.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock for synchronous operations.
    - Inside the always block, check if the reset signal is high. If so, set `q` to `32'h1`.
    - If reset is not asserted, calculate the feedback bit using the XOR of the specified tap positions.
    - Shift the LFSR and insert the feedback bit at the least significant bit (LSB).

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module(
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,    // Active-high synchronous reset to 32'h1
    output reg [31:0] q
); 
    wire feedback;

    // Feedback calculation using XOR of the tap positions
    assign feedback = q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0];

    // Always block for synchronous logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) 
            q <= 32'h1; // Synchronous reset to 32'h1
        else 
            q <= {q[30:0], feedback}; // Shift left and insert the feedback bit
    end
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- The module `top_module` takes in a clock signal (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset`). The output is a 32-bit register `q`.
- The feedback bit is calculated using the XOR of the selected tap positions (32, 22, 2, and 1).
- On the rising edge of the clock:
  - If `reset` is high, `q` is set to `32'h1`.
  - If `reset` is low, the LFSR shifts left by one position, and the feedback bit is inserted at the LSB.
