Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - A population count circuit counts the number of '1's in an input vector.
    - The input vector is 255 bits wide.
    - The output is an 8-bit number that represents the count of '1's in the input vector.
    
2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Input: `in[254:0]`
    - Output: `out[7:0]`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - We need to iterate over each bit of the input vector and count the number of '1's.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use a `for` loop within an always block to iterate over each bit of the input vector.
    - Inside the loop, increment a counter each time a '1' is encountered.
    - Assign the count to the output.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
    - Use an always block to implement the logic.
    - Initialize a counter and use a `for` loop to check each bit of the input vector.
    - Count the number of '1's by incrementing the counter.
    - Assign the final count to the output.

Here is the Verilog code for the population count circuit:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input wire [254:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] out
);
    integer i;
    reg [7:0] count;

    always @(*) begin
        count = 8'b0;  // Initialize count to 0
        for (i = 0; i < 255; i = i + 1) begin
            if (in[i])
                count = count + 1;
        end
        out = count;  // Assign the count to the output
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- `in` is the 255-bit input vector.
- `out` is the 8-bit output representing the number of '1's in `in`.
- A `for` loop iterates over each bit of the input vector.
- If a bit is '1', the count is incremented.
- Finally, the count is assigned to the output `out`.
