To construct a carry-select adder using three instances of the provided `add16` module and a custom-built 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Requirement**:
    - The carry-select adder breaks down the addition of two 32-bit numbers into smaller chunks to expedite the process.
    - We will divide the 32-bit addition into two 16-bit blocks.
    - The carry-in for the lower 16 bits will be fed directly, while the upper 16 bits will be calculated using two add16 instances, assuming both carry-in possibilities (0 and 1).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: Two 32-bit numbers `a` and `b`.
    - Intermediate carry output from the first add16 block.
    - Two 16-bit sums from the second and third add16 blocks depending on the possible carries.
    - Outputs: The 32-bit sum.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - Intermediate signals for carries and sums.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Instantiate three `add16` modules.
    - The first `add16` instance handles the lower 16 bits.
    - The second and third `add16` instances compute the upper 16 bits assuming carry-in of 0 and 1.
    - Use a 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer to select the correct upper 16-bit sum based on the carry-out from the first instance.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);

    wire [15:0] sum_low, sum_high_0, sum_high_1;
    wire carry_out_low, carry_out_high_0, carry_out_high_1;

    // Instantiate the first add16 for the lower 16 bits
    add16 adder_low (
        .a(a[15:0]),
        .b(b[15:0]),
        .cin(1'b0),
        .sum(sum_low),
        .cout(carry_out_low)
    );

    // Instantiate the second add16 for the upper 16 bits with carry-in of 0
    add16 adder_high_0 (
        .a(a[31:16]),
        .b(b[31:16]),
        .cin(1'b0),
        .sum(sum_high_0),
        .cout(carry_out_high_0)
    );

    // Instantiate the third add16 for the upper 16 bits with carry-in of 1
    add16 adder_high_1 (
        .a(a[31:16]),
        .b(b[31:16]),
        .cin(1'b1),
        .sum(sum_high_1),
        .cout(carry_out_high_1)
    );

    // Use a 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer to select the correct sum for the upper bits
    mux_16to1 mux_high (
        .A(sum_high_0),
        .B(sum_high_1),
        .sel(carry_out_low),
        .Y(sum[31:16])
    );

    // The final sum combines the lower sum and the selected upper sum
    assign sum[15:0] = sum_low;

endmodule

// 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer module
module mux_16to1 (
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [15:0] B,
    input wire sel,
    output wire [15:0] Y
);
    // Multiplexer logic: Y is B if sel is high, A if sel is low
    assign Y = (sel) ? B : A;
endmodule
```

In this implementation, the low bits are calculated using a direct `add16` instance while the upper bits are prepared for both possibilities of carry-in, and the correct sum is selected by a multiplexer based on the carry-out from the lower bits.
