Chain of Thought:
1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need eight D flip-flops with an active high synchronous reset.
    - All flip-flops should be triggered by the positive edge of the clock (clk).
    - Each flip-flop will have its data input (d) and corresponding output (q), with the reset signal to initialize or reset the state synchronously.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: 
        - clk: clock signal
        - reset: synchronous reset signal
        - d[7:0]: 8-bit data input
    - Outputs:
        - q[7:0]: 8-bit data output

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are needed because each D flip-flop operates independently.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock for synchronous operation.
    - In the always block, check if the reset is high. If the reset is high, set the output (q) to 0. Otherwise, assign the input (d) to the output (q).

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,            // Synchronous reset
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    // D flip-flops logic: Capture d at the rising edge of clk if reset is low; else set q to 0
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) 
            q <= 8'b00000000;
        else 
            q <= d;
    end

endmodule
```

This module captures the data input (d) into the output (q) at each rising edge of the clock as long as the reset is low. When the reset is high, it synchronously resets the output (q) to zero. Each flip-flop in the 8-bit register operates independently but shares common control signalsâ€”reset and clock.
