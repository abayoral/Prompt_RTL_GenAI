Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to create a module with 8 independent D flip-flops.
   - Each flip-flop should capture the corresponding bit from a 8-bit data input (`d`) at the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).
   - The flip-flops should include an active high synchronous reset, meaning that, during the next clock cycle after `reset` is high, all flip-flops should reset their output (`q`) to 0.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: 
     - `clk`: Clock signal for capturing data.
     - `reset`: Synchronous reset signal.
     - `d[7:0]`: 8-bit data input signal.
   - Output: 
     - `q[7:0]`: 8-bit output vector from the D flip-flops.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed, as the flip-flop logic will directly use the inputs to produce the outputs.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Begin with the module declaration, specifying inputs and outputs.
   - Use an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk`.
   - Within the always block, check the synchronous `reset` signal.
   - If `reset` is high during a clock edge, assign zeroes to `q` to signify a reset.
   - Otherwise, assign the data input `d` to `q`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,            // Synchronous reset
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    // D flip-flop logic with synchronous active high reset
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 8'b00000000; // Reset all flip-flops to zero
        else
            q <= d; // Capture the input d on positive clock edge
    end

endmodule
```

This module utilizes a single always block to implement 8 D flip-flops with an active high synchronous reset. Each bit in the output vector `q` corresponds directly to the input vector `d`, synchronously updating at each positive clock edge unless reset is active.
