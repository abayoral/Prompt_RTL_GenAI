### Chain of Thought:
1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - A 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer has to be created.
    - There are 9 data inputs (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i), each of which is 16 bits wide.
    - The `sel` input is 4 bits wide, capable of selecting one of these 9 inputs.
    - For `sel` values from 9 to 15, the output should be all '1's.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: 16-bit a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, and 4-bit sel.
    - Output: 16-bit out.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals needed, the logic is direct.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration.
    - Use an always block to implement a case statement based on `sel`.
    - Assign the corresponding input to `out` for `sel` values from 0 to 8.
    - For `sel` values from 9 to 15, assign all bits of `out` to '1'.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [15:0] a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,
    input [3:0] sel,
    output reg [15:0] out 
);
    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            4'd0: out = a;
            4'd1: out = b;
            4'd2: out = c;
            4'd3: out = d;
            4'd4: out = e;
            4'd5: out = f;
            4'd6: out = g;
            4'd7: out = h;
            4'd8: out = i;
            default: out = 16'hFFFF; // All bits '1' for sel = 9 to 15
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```
