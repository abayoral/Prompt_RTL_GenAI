Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - The module takes a 3-bit input vector (`vec`) and outputs it directly as `outv`.
   - Additionally, it splits this vector into three separate 1-bit outputs: `o0`, `o1`, and `o2`.
   - Each 1-bit output corresponds to a specific position in the input vector (`o0` corresponds to `vec[0]`, `o1` to `vec[1]`, and `o2` to `vec[2]`).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Input: `vec[2:0]`
   - Outputs: `outv[2:0]`, `o2`, `o1`, `o0`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed as we can directly connect the inputs to the outputs.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the input vector and the outputs.
   - Directly assign the input vector to `outv`.
   - Split the vector into its individual bits and assign them to `o0`, `o1`, and `o2`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [2:0] vec,
    output wire [2:0] outv,
    output wire o2,
    output wire o1,
    output wire o0
);
    // Directly forward the input vector to the output vector
    assign outv = vec;
    // Extract individual bits from the input vector to the respective outputs
    assign o0 = vec[0];
    assign o1 = vec[1];
    assign o2 = vec[2];
endmodule
```

This module effectively and efficiently routes the 3-bit input vector to both a 3-bit output vector and three individual 1-bit outputs, maintaining the intended functionality with minimal complexity.
