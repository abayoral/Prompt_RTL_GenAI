Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We are given a 3-bit input vector (`vec`).
    - The module has one 3-bit output vector (`outv`) that is the same as the input vector.
    - The module also has three separate 1-bit outputs (`o2`, `o1`, `o0`), each representing a specific bit position in the input vector.
      - `o2` should be connected to `vec[2]`.
      - `o1` should be connected to `vec[1]`.
      - `o0` should be connected to `vec[0]`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Input: `vec` (3-bit)
    - Outputs: 
        - `outv` (3-bit)
        - `o2`, `o1`, `o0` (1-bit each)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are needed as the outputs can be directly assigned from the input.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use assign statements to:
      - Directly assign `vec` to `outv`.
      - Assign the individual bits of `vec` to `o2`, `o1`, and `o0`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
    - The code should include the module definition, input/output declarations, and assigns to achieve the required connections.

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input wire [2:0] vec,
    output wire [2:0] outv,
    output wire o2,
    output wire o1,
    output wire o0
);
    // Output the same vector
    assign outv = vec;
    
    // Split the vector
    assign o2 = vec[2];
    assign o1 = vec[1];
    assign o0 = vec[0];
endmodule
```

- This code correctly assigns the 3-bit input vector `vec` to the 3-bit output vector `outv`.
- Each bit of the input vector is also separately assigned to the individual 1-bit outputs `o2`, `o1`, and `o0` as specified.
