Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The circuit has no inputs, which simplifies the design.
        The circuit has one output that should always drive 1 (logic high).
        This means the output should be tied to a logical high value, which is typically represented by constant '1' in Verilog.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: None
        Output: one

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the outputs.
        Use an assign statement to tie the output to a constant logic high value (1).

    Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module(
    output wire one
);
    // Assign logic high (1) to the output
    assign one = 1'b1;
endmodule
```

Explanation:
    - The module `top_module` has one output `one`.
    - The `assign` statement ties the output `one` to a constant logic high value `1'b1`, ensuring it always drives a logic high signal.
