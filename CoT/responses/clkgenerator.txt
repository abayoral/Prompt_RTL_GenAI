Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need to generate a periodic clock signal.
    - The signal alternates its state at consistent intervals defined by the parameter `PERIOD`.
    - The clock signal should have a square wave shape, implying it toggles state every half period.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - No external inputs are needed for the clock generation itself.
    - There is one output: `clk`.

3. **Define Parameters**:
    - The primary parameter is `PERIOD`, with a default value of 10. This determines the full cycle time of the clock signal.
    - Since the clock needs to toggle every half period, the toggle interval should be `PERIOD/2`.

4. **Initialize Clock Signal**:
    - Use an `initial` block to set the initial state of the `clk` output to 0.

5. **Clock Signal Generation**:
    - Use an `always` block with a delay mechanism to toggle the clock state at intervals of `PERIOD/2`.

6. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
    - Start with the module declaration including parameters and output.
    - Implement the `initial` block to initialize `clk`.
    - Implement the `always` block to toggle `clk` every half period.
    - Ensure that the module encapsulates all the logic needed to act as a standalone clock generator.

```verilog
module clkgenerator #(parameter PERIOD = 10) (
    output reg clk
);

    // Initial block to set the initial state of the clock to 0
    initial begin
        clk = 0;
    end

    // Always block to toggle the clock every half period
    always begin
        # (PERIOD / 2) clk = ~clk;
    end

endmodule
```

This complete Verilog module `clkgenerator` accurately generates a periodic clock signal. By using the adjustable parameter `PERIOD`, the module can adapt the frequency of the clock signal as needed, making it versatile and suitable for various applications where different clock frequencies might be required.
