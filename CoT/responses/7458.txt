Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A 7458 chip has four AND gates and two OR gates.
        For each of the two sets of inputs, the AND gates are connected to the OR gate.
        The OR gate outputs the final result.
        Eight inputs are associated with the first set: p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d (first AND gate), p1e and p1f (second AND gate).
        Four inputs are associated with the second set: p2a, p2b (first AND gate), p2c and p2d (second AND gate).
        p1y is the output of the first OR gate and p2y is the output of the second OR gate.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f, p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d
        Outputs: p1y, p2y

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        Forming two AND gates for each OR gate requires intermediate signals.
        Use wires p1_and1, p1_and2 to represent the outputs of the first AND gates and 
        wires p2_and1, p2_and2 to represent the outputs of the second AND gates.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Declare the intermediate signals.
        Use assign statements to construct the AND and OR gates.
        Using '&' for the AND operation and '|' for the OR operation.
        Each OR gate takes the outputs of two AND gates.

Writing the Verilog Code:

verilog

module top_module (
    input p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f,
    output p1y,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output p2y
);
    // Intermediate signals for AND gate outputs
    wire p1_and1, p1_and2, p2_and1, p2_and2;
    // AND gates logic
    assign p1_and1 = p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d;
    assign p1_and2 = p1e & p1f;
    assign p2_and1 = p2a & p2b;
    assign p2_and2 = p2c & p2d;
    // OR gates logic
    assign p1y = p1_and1 | p1_and2;
    assign p2y = p2_and1 | p2_and2;
endmodule
