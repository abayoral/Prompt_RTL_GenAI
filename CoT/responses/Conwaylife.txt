To implement Conway's Game of Life on a 16x16 toroidal grid, we need a mechanism to update the state of the grid based on the rules provided. Given the constraints and requirements, we'll follow these steps to generate the Verilog module:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - The grid is a 16x16 toroidal array (edges wrap around).
   - Each cell's next state is determined by its current state and the states of its 8 neighbors.
   - The rules for state transitions are:
     - 0-1 neighbor: Cell becomes 0.
     - 2 neighbors: Cell state does not change.
     - 3 neighbors: Cell becomes 1.
     - 4+ neighbors: Cell becomes 0.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk`, `load`, `data`
   - Output: `q` (16x16 array flattened to 256-bit vector)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals and Logic:**
   - We need arrays to represent the current state and the next state.
   - A function to count neighbors for each cell that handles the toroidal wrap-around.
   - An always block to update the grid state on each clock edge based on the `load` signal.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Define the 16x16 arrays for `current_state` and `next_state`.
   - Use nested loops to iterate through every cell to compute the next state based on neighbor counts.
   - Update the output `q` every clock cycle.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

Here's the completed Verilog module:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [255:0] data,
    output reg [255:0] q
);

    reg [255:0] current_state;
    reg [255:0] next_state;

    // Function to count the number of alive neighbors
    function [3:0] count_neighbors;
        input [3:0] x, y; // position in the grid
        integer dx, dy;
        reg [3:0] count;
    begin
        count = 0;
        for (dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx = dx + 1) begin
            for (dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy = dy + 1) begin
                if (!(dx == 0 && dy == 0)) begin // skip the cell itself
                    // wrap-around using modulo
                    if (current_state[(((x + dx + 16) % 16) * 16) + ((y + dy + 16) % 16)]) begin
                        count = count + 1;
                    end
                end
            end
        end
        count_neighbors = count;
    end
    endfunction

    // Compute the next state based on the current state and neighbor counts
    integer i, j;
    always @(*) begin
        for (i = 0; i < 16; i = i + 1) begin
            for (j = 0; j < 16; j = j + 1) begin
                case (count_neighbors(i, j))
                    4'b0011: next_state[(i * 16) + j] = 1; // 3 neighbors
                    4'b0010: next_state[(i * 16) + j] = current_state[(i * 16) + j]; // 2 neighbors
                    default: next_state[(i * 16) + j] = 0; // 0-1 or 4+ neighbors
                endcase
            end
        end
    end

    // Update the state on every clock cycle
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load)
            current_state <= data;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
        
        q <= current_state;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **count_neighbors Function:** This function calculates the number of alive neighbors a cell has, accounting for the toroidal wrap-around by using modulo arithmetic.
2. **always @(\*):** This block updates `next_state` by iterating through each cell and applying the Game of Life rules.
3. **always @(posedge clk):** This block updates `current_state` and `q` on each clock edge. If `load` is high, `current_state` is initialized with `data`; otherwise, `current_state` is updated to `next_state`.

This module effectively implements Conway's Game of Life in a 16x16 toroidal grid using the rules specified.
