Let's begin by understanding the problem requirements and breaking them down into manageable steps to create a `div_16bit` module that performs division using combinational logic. The goal is to implement a digital logic module that takes a 16-bit dividend and an 8-bit divisor to produce a 16-bit quotient and remainder.

### Chain of Thought

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to implement a division of a 16-bit dividend (`A`) by an 8-bit divisor (`B`).
   - We need two outputs: a 16-bit quotient (`result`) and a 16-bit remainder (`odd`).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `A` (16-bit dividend), `B` (8-bit divisor)
   - Outputs: `result` (16-bit quotient), `odd` (16-bit remainder)

3. **Division Process:**
   - Use a manual binary division method, similar to long division.
   - Use a shift-and-subtract method to perform bitwise division.

4. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Utilize two always blocks for the sequential process of division.
   - Use combinational logic to process the bits iteratively.
   - Use registers to hold the shifting dividend, the quotient, and the remainder.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**
   - Define the combinational logic that shifts the dividend and computes the difference with the divisor.
   - Update the result (quotient) and remainder in each iteration.

Now, let's implement the Verilog module using this plan:

```verilog
module div_16bit (
    input wire [15:0] A, // 16-bit dividend
    input wire [7:0] B,  // 8-bit divisor
    output reg [15:0] result, // 16-bit quotient
    output reg [15:0] odd    // 16-bit remainder
);

    // Internal register to hold the shifting dividend and temporary variables
    reg [31:0] a_reg;
    reg [7:0] b_reg;
    integer i;

    always @(*) begin
        a_reg = {16'b0, A}; // Initialize the a_reg with the dividend shifted left by 16 bits
        result = 16'b0;  // Initialize the quotient to zero
        odd = 16'b0;     // Initialize the remainder to zero
        b_reg = B;       // Capture the divisor

        if (b_reg != 0) begin  // Only perform division if the divisor is non-zero
            for (i = 15; i >= 0; i = i - 1) begin
                a_reg = a_reg << 1; // Shift the a_reg left by 1
                // Subtract the divisor from the higher order bits of a_reg
                if (a_reg[31:24] >= b_reg) begin
                    a_reg[31:24] = a_reg[31:24] - b_reg;
                    result[i] = 1'b1; // Set the result bit if the subtraction is successful
                end
            end
            odd = a_reg[23:8]; // Set the remaining relevant bits as remainder
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Start with the dividend left-shifted (in `a_reg`) and an initialized result and remainder. The dividend is prepared with zero-appended upper bits to simulate bit-by-bit processing.

- **Iterative Division**: Iterate from the most significant bit (MSB) of the dividend down to the least significant bit (LSB), simulating the division process.

- **Check and Update**: In each iteration, left-shift the intermediate register `a_reg`, check if the upper portion is greater or equal to the divisor, and update the quotient and remainder based on this check.

- **Output**: The final quotient and remainder are captured in the appropriate registers and output accordingly.

This module effectively performs division using purely combinational logic, updating the outputs whenever the inputs change.
