To create the top-level module `top_module` that correctly instantiates and connects the `mod_a` module, we need to follow these steps:

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - The `mod_a` module has 2 output ports followed by 4 input ports.
   - The task is to connect these 6 ports to `top_module`'s ports in the given order: `out1`, `out2`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `top_module` inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`
   - `top_module` outputs: `out1`, `out2`
   - These inputs/outputs need to match the internal module connections when instantiating `mod_a`.

3. **Connection Details**:
   - Connect `mod_a`'s output ports to `top_module`'s `out1` and `out2`.
   - Connect `mod_a`'s input ports to `top_module`'s `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Declare the `mod_a` instance inside the `top_module`.
   - Use named connections to link `mod_a`'s ports to `top_module`'s ports appropriately.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
   - We will instantiate `mod_a` within `top_module` and map the ports accordingly.

Here is the completed Verilog code:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

    // Instantiate the mod_a module and connect ports
    mod_a instance_name (
        .output(out1),
        .output(out2),
        .input(a),
        .input(b),
        .input(c),
        .input(d)
    );

endmodule
```

Note:
- Since Verilog doesnâ€™t allow automatic indexing into the ports based on position in instantiation for better readability and maintainability, I made use of the positional convention along with comments.

Remember Verilog follows the order of definition in the module instantiation. If the provided `mod_a` instantiation doesn't support this, we need to declare port names explicitly like shown below for a better actual synthesis.

```verilog
module mod_a ( 
    output out1, 
    output out2, 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c, 
    input d 
);

endmodule

module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

    // Instantiate the mod_a module and connect ports
    mod_a instance_name (
        .out1(out1),
        .out2(out2),
        .a(a),
        .b(b),
        .c(c),
        .d(d)
    );

endmodule
```
