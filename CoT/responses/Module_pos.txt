To fulfill the task of connecting the `mod_a` module to the `top_module`, we'll follow the requirements and instructions meticulously, connecting the ports of `mod_a` to the ports of `top_module` by their respective positions.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - We have a module named `mod_a` which has 2 output ports and 4 input ports.
   - The `top_module` has inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and outputs `out1`, `out2`.
   - The task is to instantiate `mod_a` within `top_module` such that these ports are connected by their position.

2. **Determine the Connection Mapping**:
   - According to the position:
     - `out1` is connected to the first output of `mod_a`.
     - `out2` is connected to the second output of `mod_a`.
     - `a` is connected to the first input of `mod_a`.
     - `b` is connected to the second input of `mod_a`.
     - `c` is connected to the third input of `mod_a`.
     - `d` is connected to the fourth input of `mod_a`.

3. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Declare the `top_module` using the already provided ports.
   - Inside the `top_module`, instantiate the `mod_a` and connect the ports in the order mentioned.

4. **Instantiating `mod_a`**:
   - Use positional port mapping to ensure the ports are connected correctly by their position.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

    // Instantiation of the module mod_a with positional port mapping
    mod_a instance_name (
        out1,  // First output
        out2,  // Second output
        a,     // First input
        b,     // Second input
        c,     // Third input
        d      // Fourth input
    );

endmodule
```

This code correctly sets up the module connections using positional port mapping, ensuring each port is linked according to its position in the provided specification. This is crucial for maintaining desired functionality within the hardware design, aiding in the performance and reliability of the product.
