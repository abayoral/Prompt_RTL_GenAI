Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
   - We need to build a combinational circuit with four inputs (in[3:0]).
   - There will be three outputs corresponding to the results of 4-input AND, OR, and XOR gates.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
   - Inputs: `in[3:0]`
   - Outputs: `out_and`, `out_or`, `out_xor`

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
   - No intermediate signals are needed as the logic directly maps to the outputs using combinational gates.

4. Structuring the Module:
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use three separate assign statements to implement the AND, OR, and XOR operations.
   - For the AND gate: Use the reduction AND operator (&) on `in`.
   - For the OR gate: Use the reduction OR operator (|) on `in`.
   - For the XOR gate: Use the reduction XOR operator (^) on `in`.

5. Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [3:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor
);

    // AND gate logic: all bits of in must be 1 for out_and to be 1
    assign out_and = &in;

    // OR gate logic: any bit of in being 1 will make out_or 1
    assign out_or = |in;

    // XOR gate logic: out_xor is 1 if the number of 1s in in is odd
    assign out_xor = ^in;

endmodule
```

This code defines the combinational circuit as specified, with the required AND, OR, and XOR operations on the 4-bit input `in`.
