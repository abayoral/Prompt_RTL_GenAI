Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - The objective is to identify specific arrow key scancodes from a PS/2 keyboard. The relevant scancodes correspond to the four arrow keys: left, down, right, and up.
   - A scancode is provided as a 16-bit input, and based on its value, one of the four arrow output signals should be asserted.

2. **Analyze the Scancodes and Outputs:**
   - Scancode `16'he06b` corresponds to the left arrow.
   - Scancode `16'he072` corresponds to the down arrow.
   - Scancode `16'he074` corresponds to the right arrow.
   - Scancode `16'he075` corresponds to the up arrow.
   - Any other scancode corresponds to no arrow key being pressed.

3. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Input: `scancode` [15:0]
   - Outputs: `left`, `down`, `right`, `up` (each is a 1-bit output)

4. **Plan the Implementation:**
   - Use a combinational always block that evaluates the input `scancode`.
   - First, set all outputs (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) to low (logic 0) as their default state.
   - Use a case statement to check the value of `scancode` and assert the appropriate output for arrow key scancodes.

5. **Implement the Logic:**
   - Utilize a case statement within the always block to match the scancode against known arrow values.
   - Assign a value of 1 to the respective output (left, right, up, down) based on the received scancode.

6. **Code Implementation:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up
); 

    // Combinational logic to determine arrow key outputs
    always @(*) begin
        // Default values
        left = 1'b0;
        down = 1'b0;
        right = 1'b0;
        up = 1'b0;

        // Case analysis for specific scancodes
        case (scancode)
            16'he06b: left = 1'b1;  // Left arrow scancode
            16'he072: down = 1'b1;  // Down arrow scancode
            16'he074: right = 1'b1; // Right arrow scancode
            16'he075: up = 1'b1;    // Up arrow scancode
            default: ; // All outputs remain at their default value of 0
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

This module correctly interprets the 16-bit scancode input to determine which arrow key is pressed and assigns a high value to the respective output signal, ensuring a precise response for the scancode input received.
