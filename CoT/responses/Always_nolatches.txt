## Chain of Thought

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - The circuit needs to decode a 16-bit scancode to determine if one of the four arrow keys on a keyboard has been pressed.
    - Four specific scancodes map to the four arrow keys:
        - `16'hE06B` → left arrow.
        - `16'hE072` → down arrow.
        - `16'hE074` → right arrow.
        - `16'hE075` → up arrow.
    - If none of these scancodes are detected, no arrow key is pressed.
    - The module has one 16-bit input (`scancode`) and four 1-bit outputs (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Input: `scancode` [15:0]
    - Outputs: `left`, `down`, `right`, `up`

3. **Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are needed because the logic is straightforward; it can be implemented directly in a combinational always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use a combinational always block to evaluate the `scancode` and set the outputs accordingly.
    - Before the case statement, initialize all outputs to zero to avoid creating latches.
    - Use a case statement to decode the `scancode` and set the appropriate output to 1 based on the scancode value.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up
);

    // Combinational logic to decode the scancode and determine which arrow key is pressed
    always @(*) begin
        // Initialize all outputs to zero
        left = 1'b0;
        down = 1'b0;
        right = 1'b0;
        up = 1'b0;
        
        // Decode the scancode and assert the corresponding output
        case (scancode)
            16'hE06B: left = 1'b1;    // Left arrow
            16'hE072: down = 1'b1;    // Down arrow
            16'hE074: right = 1'b1;   // Right arrow
            16'hE075: up = 1'b1;      // Up arrow
            default: ; // Keep all output signals low
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

In this code, all four output signals are initialized to zero at the start of the always block. The case statement then checks the value of `scancode` and sets the appropriate one of the four outputs to 1 if the scancode matches any of the predefined values for the arrow keys. The default case is implicitly handled by the initial assignment to zero, ensuring no latches are created.
