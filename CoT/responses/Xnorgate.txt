Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - An XNOR gate produces an output of 1 if both inputs are the same (either both 0 or both 1), and 0 otherwise.
    - This can be achieved by negating the result of an XOR gate.
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`
    - Output: `out`

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `a`, `b` (1-bit each)
    - Output: `out` (1-bit)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are needed because the logic is simple and can be implemented directly.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an assign statement to define the output.
    - Calculate the XOR of inputs `a` and `b` and then negate it to get the XNOR result.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out 
);
    // XNOR logic: out is the negation of the XOR of a and b
    assign out = ~(a ^ b);
endmodule
```

Explanation:
- `assign out = ~(a ^ b);` uses the XOR operator `^` to calculate the XOR of `a` and `b`, and then the bitwise negation operator `~` to flip the result, which effectively implements the XNOR gate.
