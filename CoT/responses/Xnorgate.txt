To implement an XNOR gate in Verilog, we need to understand the basic functionality of the XNOR gate. An XNOR gate produces a high output (logic 1) when both inputs are the same, and a low output (logic 0) when the inputs are different.

Here's the step-by-step thought process:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - An XNOR gate outputs 1 if the inputs are both 0 or both 1.
    - It uses the logical equivalence operator to achieve this output.
    - In Verilog, while there is no direct logical-XNOR operator, we can use the result of XOR operation (`^`) and invert it to create an XNOR behavior.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `a`, `b` (both are single-bit inputs).
    - Output: `out` (single-bit result).

3. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use the bitwise-XOR operator followed by a bitwise negation to implement the XNOR logic.
    - The logic formula for the XNOR operation is `!(a ^ b)` or `~(a ^ b)` in Verilog.
  
4. **Writing the Verilog Code:**
   - Use an `assign` statement to define the output as the negation of the XOR result of inputs `a` and `b`.

The final Verilog code for the XNOR gate is as follows:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out
);
    // XNOR logic: out is 1 when both a and b are the same
    assign out = ~(a ^ b);
endmodule
```

This simple approach ensures that the module successfully replicates the expected XNOR functionality using Verilog's operators.
