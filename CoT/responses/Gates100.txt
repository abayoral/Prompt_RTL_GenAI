Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need to build a combinational circuit with 100 inputs and 3 outputs.
    - The outputs are:
        - `out_and`: Result of a 100-input AND gate.
        - `out_or`: Result of a 100-input OR gate.
        - `out_xor`: Result of a 100-input XOR gate.
    - The reduction operators in Verilog can be used to perform bitwise reduction on arrays of bits.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `in` which is a 100-bit wide input.
    - Outputs: `out_and`, `out_or`, and `out_xor`.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are needed because we can directly use the reduction operators to produce the required outputs.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - We need to declare the module, specify the inputs and outputs.
    - Use the reduction AND (`&`), reduction OR (`|`), and reduction XOR (`^`) operators to compute the outputs.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor 
);
    // Reduction AND for out_and
    assign out_and = &in;
    
    // Reduction OR for out_or
    assign out_or = |in;
    
    // Reduction XOR for out_xor
    assign out_xor = ^in;
    
endmodule
```

Explanation:

- **Reduction AND (`&`)**: This operator will perform a bitwise AND operation across all 100 bits of the input `in`, resulting in a single output bit set to 1 only if all bits of `in` are 1.
- **Reduction OR (`|`)**: This operator will perform a bitwise OR operation across all 100 bits of the input `in`, resulting in a single output bit set to 1 if at least one bit of `in` is 1.
- **Reduction XOR (`^`)**: This operator will perform a bitwise XOR operation across all 100 bits of the input `in`, resulting in a single output bit set to 1 if there is an odd number of 1-bits in `in`.

The Verilog code uses these operators to generate the outputs `out_and`, `out_or`, and `out_xor` respectively.
