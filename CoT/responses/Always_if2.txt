Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
    - `shut_off_computer` should be set to `1` only if `cpu_overheated` is true.
    - `keep_driving` should be set to `0` if `arrived` is true or `gas_tank_empty` is true. Otherwise, it should be `1`.

2. Detect the Issues in the Provided Code:
    - The `shut_off_computer` assignment happens only when `cpu_overheated` is true, creating a latch since it doesn't handle other cases.
    - The `keep_driving` assignment doesn't handle all scenarios, specifically the scenario when `arrived` is true.

3. Fix the Latch and Ensure Correct Assignments:
    - The statements should handle the else conditions to avoid latches.
    - Add explicit else statements to ensure every possible input condition is handled.

4. Structuring the Corrected Module:
    - Use `else` branches to handle conditions for `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving`.

5. Writing the Corrected Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
    );

    // Fix the bug in the following code
    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated) begin
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        end else begin
            shut_off_computer = 0;
        end
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (arrived) begin
            keep_driving = 0;
        end else begin
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

In this corrected code:
- The `shut_off_computer` is set to `0` in the `else` branch if `cpu_overheated` is not true, avoiding the latch.
- The `keep_driving` is set to `0` if `arrived` is true. If `arrived` is not true, it is set to `~gas_tank_empty`, ensuring all cases are covered.
