Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - For an 8-bit input vector, detect when there is a 0 to 1 transition for each bit.
    - The output should be set to 1 for the bit where the transition occurs, one clock cycle after the transition.
    - The signal should be checked in a synchronous manner, based on the clock signal.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `in[7:0]` (8-bit input vector)
    - Outputs: `pedge[7:0]` (8-bit output vector for positive edge detection)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - Store the previous state of the input signal to detect the transition using a register array.
    - A register array `prev_in` will be used to store the previous state of `in`.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an `always` block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to update the state of the previous input.
    - In the same `always` block, compare the current input with the previous stored input to detect a 0 to 1 transition.
    - If a transition is detected, set the corresponding bit of the output `pedge` to 1, otherwise 0.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);
    // Register to hold the previous state of the input
    reg [7:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Detect the 0 to 1 transition for each bit
        pedge <= (in & ~prev_in);

        // Update the previous state to current state
        prev_in <= in;
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- `prev_in` is used to store the previous state of the input vector `in`.
- On the rising edge of the `clk`, `prev_in` is updated to the current state of `in`.
- `pedge` is assigned the value of the bitwise AND between the current state of `in` and the bitwise NOT of `prev_in`.
    - This effectively detects a 0 to 1 transition as the result will only be high (1) if the current `in` bit is 1 and the corresponding `prev_in` bit was 0.
