Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A population count circuit counts the number of '1's in an input vector.
        In this case, the input vector is a 3-bit number (in).
        The output should be the count of '1's in the input vector (out).
        Since the maximum count of '1's in a 3-bit vector is 3, the output can be a 2-bit number.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: in[2:0]
        Outputs: out[1:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No additional intermediate signals are required. 

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use bitwise operations and addition to count the number of '1's in the input vector.
        Combine the results to derive the final count.

    Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module population_count (
    input wire [2:0] in,
    output wire [1:0] out
);
    // Population count logic: Sum the number of '1's in the input vector
    assign out = in[0] + in[1] + in[2];
endmodule
```

Explanation:
    1. Using a straightforward assign statement to sum the bits in the input vector.
    2. Each bit (in[0], in[1], and in[2]) contributes to the count if it is '1'.
    3. The sum of these bits gives the population count, which is then assigned to the output (out).
