To create a module containing 8 D flip-flops with active high asynchronous reset, triggered by the positive edge of the clock (clk), we need to ensure that each flip-flop handles the reset signal independently and asynchronously. In this design, when the reset signal (`areset`) is high, the output of each flip-flop (`q`) should be reset to zero regardless of the clock signal. When the reset is not active, the flip-flops will capture the input data (`d`) on the rising edge of the clock.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need 8 D flip-flops with a shared clock (`clk`) and asynchronous reset (`areset`).
   - Each flip-flop will have a data input from the vector `d` and provide an output in the vector `q`.
   - The reset should be active high, meaning it will reset `q` to zero regardless of the clock.

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk` (clock), `areset` (asynchronous reset), `d[7:0]` (8-bit data input)
   - Outputs: `q[7:0]` (8-bit output)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed as the logic of each flip-flop is straightforward.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Use an always block sensitive to both the positive edge of `clk` and the level of `areset`.
   - Within the always block, check if `areset` is high to reset `q`.
   - If `areset` is low, capture the value of `d` on the positive edge of `clk`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module dff_array (
    input wire clk,
    input wire areset,   // active high asynchronous reset
    input wire [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    // Define flip-flop logic with asynchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            q <= 8'b0;   // Reset q to zero when areset is high
        end else begin
            q <= d;      // Capture the value of d on the rising edge of clk
        end
    end
endmodule
```

This design will ensure that all D flip-flops reset their output to zero when the asynchronous reset is active, independent of clock activity. When the reset is not active, they will latch the input data on every rising edge of the clock. This approach maintains synchronous capture of input data and ensures that the reset operation is immediate, meeting the design specifications.
