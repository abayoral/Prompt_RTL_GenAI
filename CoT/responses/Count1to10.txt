Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - A decade counter that counts from 1 to 10 repeatedly.
    - The counter should increment on each rising edge of the clock.
    - If the counter reaches 10, it should reset back to 1 on the next clock cycle.
    - A synchronous reset input should reset the counter to 1.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `clk` (clock), `reset` (synchronous reset signal)
    - Output: `q[3:0]` (4-bit output representing the current count)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are necessary for this simple counting logic.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, including the input and output ports.
    - Utilize an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
    - Implement a synchronous reset inside the always block.
    - On the rising edge of the clock, if `reset` is active (high), set the counter to 1.
    - If `reset` is not active and the counter is less than 10, increment the counter.
    - If the counter is 10, reset it back to 1.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
   - Implement the above logic to ensure the counter behaves correctly under synchronous reset and normal operation conditions.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Counter logic: Reset q to 1 when reset is high, otherwise count from 1 to 10
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 4'b0001;  // Reset counter to 1
        else if (q == 4'b1010)
            q <= 4'b0001;  // Reset counter to 1 after reaching 10
        else
            q <= q + 1;    // Increment counter
    end
endmodule
```

This Verilog module for a decade counter is designed to count from 1 to 10 with a synchronous reset occurring on the rising edge of the clock. The counter uses a 4-bit output (`q`) to represent its current state and follows the provided specifications accurately.
