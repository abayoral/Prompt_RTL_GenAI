### Chain of Thought:

**Understand the Requirements:**
- A decade counter counts from 1 to 10.
- After reaching 10, it should wrap around to 1.
- The counter should reset to 1 on a synchronous reset signal.
- Inputs: `clk`, `reset`
- Output: `q[3:0]` (because the range 1 through 10 can be represented with 4 bits)

**Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
- Inputs: `clk` (clock), `reset` (synchronous reset)
- Output: `q` (4-bit output representing the counter value)

**Define Intermediate Signals:**
- No intermediate signals are required for basic counter functionality.

**Structuring the Module:**
1. Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
2. Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
3. Inside the always block, handle the synchronous reset.
    - If the reset signal is high, set `q` to 1.
    - Otherwise, increment `q` by one if `q` is less than 10.
    - If `q` is 10, wrap around to 1.

**Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);
    // Decade counter logic: Synchronous reset to 1 and count from 1 to 10
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 4'b0001;  // Reset q to 1
        else if (q == 4'b1010)  // If q is 10
            q <= 4'b0001;  // Wrap around to 1
        else
            q <= q + 1;  // Otherwise, increment q
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **`posedge clk`**: The always block is triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
- **`if (reset)`**: If the reset signal is high, the counter `q` is set to 1.
- **`else if (q == 4'd10)`**: If the current value of `q` is 10, then reset `q` to 1.
- **`else`**: Increment the counter `q` by 1 otherwise.

This logic ensures that the decade counter counts from 1 to 10 and wraps around correctly after reaching 10, with a synchronous reset that sets it back to 1.
