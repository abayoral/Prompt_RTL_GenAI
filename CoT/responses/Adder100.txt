Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - We need to add two 100-bit numbers `a` and `b`, along with a carry-in (`cin`), to produce a 100-bit sum (`sum`) and a carry-out (`cout`).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Inputs: `a` [99:0], `b` [99:0], `cin`
   - Outputs: `cout`, `sum` [99:0]

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
   - We need intermediate signals to capture the carries generated after adding each bit position.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use the addition operator to sum `a`, `b`, and `cin` since the internal carry logic will handle the bit-wise addition for us.
   - Capture the carry-out by checking the MSB of the extended addition.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
   - The sum of `a`, `b`, and `cin` will result in a 101-bit number (`{temp_carry, temp_sum}`), where `temp_carry` is the carry-out and `temp_sum` is the sum.

Here is the Verilog code for the 100-bit binary adder:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output cout,
    output [99:0] sum );

    // Intermediate signal to hold the sum and carry-out of the addition
    wire [100:0] temp_sum;

    // Adding a, b, and cin
    assign temp_sum = a + b + cin;

    // Assign sum and cout from the results
    assign sum = temp_sum[99:0];
    assign cout = temp_sum[100];

endmodule
```

**Explanation**:
- The `assign temp_sum = a + b + cin;` line creates a temporary 101-bit signal where the addition of a, b, and cin is stored.
- The `sum` is assigned the lower 100 bits of `temp_sum`.
- The `cout` is assigned the MSB (most significant bit) of `temp_sum`, which represents the carry-out of the addition.
