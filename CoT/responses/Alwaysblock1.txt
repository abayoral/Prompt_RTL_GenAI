Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need to implement an AND gate using both an `assign` statement and a `combinational always block`.
    - The module has two inputs: `a`, `b`, and two outputs: `out_assign`, `out_alwaysblock`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`
    - Outputs: `out_assign` (wire, assigned using `assign` statement), `out_alwaysblock` (reg, assigned within an always block)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are needed as the logic is straightforward: just an AND operation.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration.
    - Use an `assign` statement to define `out_assign` as the AND of `a` and `b`.
    - Use an `always @*` block (combinational logic) to define `out_alwaysblock` as the AND of `a` and `b`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
    - Define the module with the required inputs and outputs.
    - Implement the `assign` statement for `out_assign`.
    - Implement the always block to set `out_alwaysblock`.

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a, 
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_alwaysblock
);

    // AND gate using assign statement
    assign out_assign = a & b;

    // AND gate using combinational always block
    always @(*) begin
        out_alwaysblock = a & b;
    end

endmodule
```

Explanation:
- The `assign` statement is straightforward and continuously assigns `out_assign` to be the result of `a & b`.
- The `always @(*)` block (combinational always block) updates `out_alwaysblock` whenever there is a change in any of the inputs `a` or `b`. Here, the same AND operation `a & b` is used within the block.
