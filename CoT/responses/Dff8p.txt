Sure, let's break down the task and implement the required Verilog module.

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need 8 D flip-flops.
    - The flip-flops must have an active high synchronous reset.
    - On reset, the flip-flops should be set to `0x34` rather than zero.
    - The flip-flops should trigger on the negative edge of the clock (`clk`).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** `clk`, `reset`, and an 8-bit input `d`.
    - **Outputs:** An 8-bit output `q`.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are necessary as our logic will be directly implemented in the always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block triggered on the negative edge of the clock.
    - Inside the always block, check if the reset signal is high.
    - If reset is high, assign the value `0x34` to `q`.
    - Otherwise, assign `d` to `q`.

### Writing the Verilog Code:

Here's the complete Verilog implementation:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    // D Flip-Flop logic with synchronous reset to 0x34 triggered on negative edge of clk
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 8'h34; // reset value 0x34 (hexadecimal)
        else
            q <= d;
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration:**
    - The module is named `top_module`.
    - It has three inputs: `clk`, `reset`, and an 8-bit `d`.
    - It has one 8-bit output `q`.

- **Always Block:**
    - The block is triggered on the negative edge of the clock signal (`negedge clk`).
    - If the `reset` signal is high, `q` is set to `0x34`.
    - If the `reset` signal is low, `q` is set to `d`.

This implementation ensures that all 8 D flip-flops are reset to `0x34` when the synchronous reset signal is active and the flip-flops are triggered by the negative edge of the clock.
