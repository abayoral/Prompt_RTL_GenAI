### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - This is a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9.
   - The counter has an enable control signal (`slowena`), which allows the counter to increment only when it is high.
   - The reset is synchronous, which means the reset condition should be handled within the clocked process.
   - The counter should output a 4-bit value (`q`), representing the current count.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `slowena` (enable control signal), `reset` (synchronous reset)
   - Outputs: `q` (4-bit counter output)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are strictly necessary, but we'll use a register to hold the counter state.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
   - Inside the always block, first check the reset condition.
   - If reset is active, set the counter (`q`) to 0.
   - If reset is not active, check the enable signal (`slowena`).
   - If `slowena` is high, increment the counter. If the counter reaches 9, wrap it around back to 0.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**
```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input slowena,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);
    // Decade counter logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 4'b0000; // Reset counter to 0
        end else if (slowena) begin
            if (q == 4'b1001) begin
                q <= 4'b0000; // Wrap around when the counter reaches 9
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1; // Increment the counter
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

In this code:
- The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the logic is executed on every rising edge of the clock signal.
- The `if (reset)` condition checks if the reset signal is active and, if so, sets the counter to 0.
- The `else if (slowena)` condition checks if the enable signal is active.
  - If `q` reaches 9, it sets `q` back to 0.
  - Otherwise, it increments `q` by 1.
