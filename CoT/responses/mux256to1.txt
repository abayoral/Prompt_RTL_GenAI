To create a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog, you have a single 256-bit input vector and an 8-bit select line. The main task is to use the `sel` input to select the correct bit from the input vector `in`. In this case, using a variable index for selecting a single bit from the vector is allowed, and quite efficient.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - We need to select one bit from a 256-bit vector based on an 8-bit selection input.
   - The select input is 8 bits wide, which can represent values from 0 to 255, perfectly mapping to the indices of the input vector.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Input: `in` (256-bit wide), `sel` (8 bits wide).
   - Output: `out` (single bit).

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
   - No intermediate signals are needed because the logic can be directly expressed using the input vector index.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - We will use a compact Verilog syntax by directly indexing the `in` vector using the `sel` value.
   - This operation is efficient as Verilog allows variable indexing of vectors.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
   - Directly use `assign` to map the output `out` to the selected bit of the input vector `in` using the select line `sel`.

Here's the corresponding Verilog code:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [255:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output out
);
    // Multiplexer logic: Select the bit from the input vector based on sel
    assign out = in[sel];
endmodule
```

This module accomplishes the task by indexing into the 256-bit vector `in` using the 8-bit `sel` input, and its output is the selected bit. The design is both effective and synthesizable, making it suitable for high-performance hardware products.
