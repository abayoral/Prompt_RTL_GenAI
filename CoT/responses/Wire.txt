Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
   - The module is required to have one input and one output.
   - The output should simply reflect the input, effectively acting as a wire.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
   - Input: `in`
   - Output: `out`

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
   - No intermediate signals are needed since it's a direct wire connection.

4. Structuring the Module:
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the input (`in`) and output (`out`).
   - Use an assign statement to directly connect the input (`in`) to the output (`out`).

5. Writing the Verilog Code:
   - Given the straightforward nature of the requirement, the `assign` statement should directly map `out` to `in`.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire in,   // Input signal
    output wire out  // Output signal
);
    // Direct wire connection
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```

This code will create a module where the output (`out`) directly reflects the input (`in`), effectively making it act like a wire.
