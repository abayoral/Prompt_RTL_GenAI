Certainly! I'll go ahead and create the Verilog module according to the given specification. We'll implement two 2-to-1 multiplexers, one using assign statements and the other using a procedural if statement. 

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - A 2-to-1 multiplexer chooses between inputs `a` and `b`.
    - The choice is made based on the select signals `sel_b1` and `sel_b2`.
    - If both `sel_b1` and `sel_b2` are true, output `b`, otherwise output `a`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `sel_b1`, `sel_b2`
    - Outputs: `out_assign`, `out_always`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - For the first multiplexer, use an assign statement.
    - For the second multiplexer, use an always block with an if statement.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Declare the module, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use the assign statement for the first multiplexer.
    - Use an always block with a procedural if statement for the second multiplexer.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire sel_b1,
    input wire sel_b2,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always
); 

    // Multiplexer logic using assign statements
    assign out_assign = (sel_b1 && sel_b2) ? b : a;

    // Multiplexer logic using an always block and if statement
    always @(*) begin
        if (sel_b1 && sel_b2)
            out_always = b;
        else
            out_always = a;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`out_assign`:** This uses an assign statement with a conditional (ternary) operator to select between `a` and `b` based on the values of `sel_b1` and `sel_b2`.
- **`out_always`:** This uses a procedural always block, which executes whenever any of its inputs change, and an if-else statement to select between `a` and `b` based on the values of `sel_b1` and `sel_b2`.

Both implementations achieve the same functionality but use different methods to illustrate the flexibility in Verilog for defining logic.
