Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - A NOR gate performs the OR operation on its inputs and then inverts the result.
   - Inputs are `a` and `b`.
   - The output is `out`, which is the NOR of `a` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a`, `b`
   - Output: `out`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - The output `out` will be the NOR of `a` and `b`.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an `assign` statement to implement the NOR gate logic.
   - The NOR gate can be implemented using the OR operator followed by a NOT operator.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input wire a, 
    input wire b, 
    output wire out 
);
    // NOR gate logic: out is the complement of a OR b
    assign out = ~(a | b);
endmodule
```

This Verilog module defines a NOR gate by performing the OR operation on `a` and `b`, and then inverting the result to get the NOR output `out`.
