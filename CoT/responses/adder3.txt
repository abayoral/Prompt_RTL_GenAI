Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A Ripple-Carry Adder is a kind of binary parallel adder. Here, A and B are the binary numbers being added together and cin is the carry input. 
        The numbers being added are A = A[2:0] and B = B[2:0].
        Like with any other adder, the result of the addition is the sum = sum[2:0], and the output carry is cout = cout[2:0].

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: A, B, Cin
        Outputs: Sum, Cout
    
    Define Intermediate Signals:
        The intermediate signals are the carries between the Full Adder stages
        
    Defining Full_Adder Module:
        Before designing the main module, you need to define the full_adder module which is the basic building block used to construct 3-bit Ripple-Carry Adder.
        Full adder is a digital circuit to perform arithmetic sum of three bits.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Instantiate three Full Adders to make 3-bit Ripple-Carry Adder.
        The output of every adder is connected with the input of the next adder.

    Writing the Verilog Code:

    verilog

    // Full Adder module
    module full_adder (
        input a, b, cin,
        output sum, cout
    );
        assign {cout, sum} = a + b + cin;
    endmodule

    // 3-bit Ripple-Carry Adder
    module top_module( 
        input [2:0] a, b,
        input cin,
        output [2:0] cout,
        output [2:0] sum
    );
        wire c1, c2;

        full_adder fa1 (.a(a[0]), .b(b[0]), .cin(cin), .sum(sum[0]), .cout(c1));
        full_adder fa2 (.a(a[1]), .b(b[1]), .cin(c1), .sum(sum[1]), .cout(c2));
        full_adder fa3 (.a(a[2]), .b(b[2]), .cin(c2), .sum(sum[2]), .cout(cout[2]));

        assign cout = {c2, c1, cout[2]};

    endmodule

    This code should work to create a 3-bit Ripple-Carry Adder.
