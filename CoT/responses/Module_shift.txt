Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - We need to use three instances of the provided `my_dff` D flip-flop module to create a 3-bit shift register.
   - Each D flip-flop will capture the value on its data input (`d`) on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`) and hold that value on its output (`q`).
   - The output of each D flip-flop will be connected to the input of the next D flip-flop in the chain, forming the shift register.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Input: `clk` (clock), `d` (data input)
   - Output: `q` (output of the last D flip-flop in the chain)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
   - We need signals to connect the output of the first flip-flop to the input of the second flip-flop, and the output of the second flip-flop to the input of the third flip-flop.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Declare intermediate signals to connect the `q` outputs of the first and second flip-flops to the `d` inputs of the second and third flip-flops.
   - Instantiate three instances of the `my_dff` module and connect them together to form the shift register.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
   - Instantiate the three D flip-flops, connect their `clk` ports together, and properly connect their `d` and `q` ports to form a shift register.
   - The `d` input of the first flip-flop is connected to the module's `d` input.
   - The `q` output of the third flip-flop is connected to the module's `q` output.

Here is the code:

```verilog
module top_module ( input clk, input d, output q );
    // Intermediate signals to connect the D flip-flops
    wire q1, q2;

    // Instantiate the three D flip-flops
    my_dff dff1 ( .clk(clk), .d(d), .q(q1) );
    my_dff dff2 ( .clk(clk), .d(q1), .q(q2) );
    my_dff dff3 ( .clk(clk), .d(q2), .q(q) );

endmodule
```

In the above code:
- The first `my_dff` instance captures the input `d` on the rising clock edge and outputs it to `q1`.
- The second `my_dff` instance captures `q1` on the rising clock edge and outputs it to `q2`.
- The third `my_dff` instance captures `q2` on the rising clock edge and outputs it to the module's output `q`.
- This forms a 3-bit shift register as required.
