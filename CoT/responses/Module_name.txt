Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
    - The task is to instantiate the `mod_a` module within the `top_module` and connect its ports correctly by name.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
    - The `mod_a` module has 4 inputs and 2 outputs.
    - The `top_module` also has 4 inputs and 2 outputs which are connected by name to the corresponding ports of `mod_a`.

3. Structuring the Module:
    - Start with the module declaration for `top_module`.
    - Inside the `top_module`, instantiate the `mod_a` module.
    - Use named port connections in the instantiation to ensure that each port of `mod_a` is correctly connected to the corresponding port of `top_module`.

4. Writing the Verilog Code:
    - The instantiation will follow the format: `.port_in_mod_a(port_in_top_module)` for each of the 6 ports.

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);
    // Instantiate mod_a and connect ports by name
    mod_a u_mod_a (
        .out1(out1),  // Connect mod_a output out1 to top_module output out1
        .out2(out2),  // Connect mod_a output out2 to top_module output out2
        .in1(a),      // Connect top_module input a to mod_a input in1
        .in2(b),      // Connect top_module input b to mod_a input in2
        .in3(c),      // Connect top_module input c to mod_a input in3
        .in4(d)       // Connect top_module input d to mod_a input in4
    );
endmodule
```

This solution fills in the `top_module` with an instantiation of `mod_a` and connects the ports as required by using named port connections, ensuring clarity and correctness.
