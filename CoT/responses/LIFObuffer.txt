To design a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer module named `LIFObuffer`, we will follow the provided specifications. Here's a clear breakdown and the Verilog implementation:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - We need a 4-entry deep LIFO buffer with each entry being 4 bits wide.
   - It uses push and pop operations controlled by a read/write signal (`RW`). A `0` for push and a `1` for pop.
   - A reset (`Rst`) initializes the buffer, setting it to an empty state.
   - `EN` signal allows operations when high.
   - The buffer also needs to indicate when it's full or empty.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Inputs**: `dataIn[3:0]`, `RW`, `EN`, `Rst`, `Clk`
   - **Outputs**: `EMPTY`, `FULL`, `dataOut[3:0]`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
   - `stack_mem`: an array to store the 4-bit data entries.
   - `SP`: a stack pointer to keep track of the top of the stack.
   - Additional signals to aid control logic.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Begin with a module declaration specifying inputs and outputs.
   - Use an internal array for `stack_mem` and a register for `SP`.
   - Use an `always` block triggered by the rising edge of `Clk` to perform synchronous operations.
   - Use conditional statements to handle reset and enable conditions.
   - Implement logic for push and pop operations and update `FULL` and `EMPTY` flags accordingly.

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
module LIFObuffer (
    input wire [3:0] dataIn,
    input wire RW,
    input wire EN,
    input wire Rst,
    input wire Clk,
    output reg EMPTY,
    output reg FULL,
    output reg [3:0] dataOut
);
    // Internal storage for the LIFO buffer
    reg [3:0] stack_mem [0:3];
    reg [2:0] SP;  // Stack pointer; we use 3 bits for safety, though ranges from 0 to 4

    // Initialization
    initial begin
        SP = 3;
        EMPTY = 1;
        FULL = 0;
    end

    always @(posedge Clk or posedge Rst) begin
        if (Rst) begin
            // Reset the buffer and the stack pointer
            SP <= 3;
            EMPTY <= 1;
            FULL <= 0;
        end else if (EN) begin
            case (RW)
                0: begin // Push operation
                    if (!FULL) begin
                        stack_mem[SP] <= dataIn;
                        if (SP > 0) begin
                            SP <= SP - 1;
                        end
                    end
                end
                1: begin // Pop operation
                    if (!EMPTY) begin
                        dataOut <= stack_mem[SP + 1];
                        if (SP < 3) begin
                            SP <= SP + 1;
                        end
                    end
                end
            endcase
        end

        // Update FULL and EMPTY flags
        EMPTY <= (SP == 3);
        FULL <= (SP == 0);
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Reset Logic**: Clears the stack and sets the pointer to indicate an empty stack.
- **Push Operation**: Decrements the stack pointer (SP) unless the stack is full, at which point it receives new data (`dataIn`).
- **Pop Operation**: Increments SP to get the next item, but only if the stack isn't empty, placing the data into `dataOut`.
- **Empty/Full Flags**: Managed based on the stack pointer value, determining the state of the buffer as empty or full. 

This solution outlines a simple yet effective LIFO buffer utilizing the core principles of stack operations tailored with specified control signals.
