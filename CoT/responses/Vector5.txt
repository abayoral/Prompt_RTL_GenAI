Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We have five 1-bit inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`.
    - We need to perform all pairwise comparisons among these inputs.
    - The result of each comparison should be stored in a corresponding bit of a 25-bit output vector `out`.
    - The bit in the output should be `1` if the two compared bits are equal (XNOR operation).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`
    - Output: `out[24:0]`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals required as we will use direct XNOR operations.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration with defined inputs and outputs.
    - Use assign statements to perform each pairwise comparison.
    - Store the results of these comparisons in the corresponding bits of the `out` vector.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
    - We use a series of assign statements to calculate each of the 25 bits in the `out` vector using XNOR (equivalent to â‰ˆ XOR followed by inversion).

Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a, b, c, d, e,
    output wire [24:0] out
);
    // Perform all pairwise comparisons and store the results in `out`
    assign out[24] = ~(a ^ a); // Always 1 because a == a
    assign out[23] = ~(a ^ b);
    assign out[22] = ~(a ^ c);
    assign out[21] = ~(a ^ d);
    assign out[20] = ~(a ^ e);
    
    assign out[19] = ~(b ^ a);
    assign out[18] = ~(b ^ b); // Always 1 because b == b
    assign out[17] = ~(b ^ c);
    assign out[16] = ~(b ^ d);
    assign out[15] = ~(b ^ e);
    
    assign out[14] = ~(c ^ a);
    assign out[13] = ~(c ^ b);
    assign out[12] = ~(c ^ c); // Always 1 because c == c
    assign out[11] = ~(c ^ d);
    assign out[10] = ~(c ^ e);
    
    assign out[9] = ~(d ^ a);
    assign out[8] = ~(d ^ b);
    assign out[7] = ~(d ^ c);
    assign out[6] = ~(d ^ d); // Always 1 because d == d
    assign out[5] = ~(d ^ e);
    
    assign out[4] = ~(e ^ a);
    assign out[3] = ~(e ^ b);
    assign out[2] = ~(e ^ c);
    assign out[1] = ~(e ^ d);
    assign out[0] = ~(e ^ e); // Always 1 because e == e
endmodule
```

This code sets up a series of XNOR operations for each pairwise combination of the inputs and stores the results in the `out` vector. Each input is compared with itself and with all other inputs, with the result being `1` if the bits are equal and `0` otherwise.
