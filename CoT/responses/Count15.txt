To build a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15, we need to create a module with the required features as outlined in the task description. Let's break down the requirements and create the module step-by-step.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - The module is a 4-bit binary counter, which implies it has the capacity to count from 0 to 15.
   - The counter needs to have a period of 16, which means it should count continuously from 0 to 15 and then wrap back to 0.
   - A synchronous reset input is provided which will reset the counter back to 0 when activated.
   - The reset is active-high, meaning the counter resets when the reset signal is high.
   - The counter increments its value on each rising edge of the clock.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk`, `reset`
   - Output: `q[3:0]` (to hold the 4-bit binary count)

3. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Begin with the module declaration specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an `always` block triggered by the rising edge of the `clk` to implement the counter logic.
   - Inside the `always` block, check if the `reset` signal is high. If it is, set the counter (`q`) to 0.
   - If the `reset` signal is not high, increment the counter value by 1, wrapping around after reaching 15.

4. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,      // Synchronous active-high reset
    output reg [3:0] q     // 4-bit output to hold the count
);

    // Counter logic: Reset to 0 if reset is high, otherwise increment count
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 4'b0000;  // Reset counter to 0
        else
            q <= q + 1;    // Increment counter
    end

endmodule
```

This Verilog module defines a 4-bit synchronous binary counter with an active-high reset signal, providing the desired functionality of counting from 0 to 15 and then wrapping back to 0, ensuring a period of 16.
