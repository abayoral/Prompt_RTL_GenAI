To create a Multiplying Accumulator (MAC) module in Verilog that processes 32-bit integers, we'll follow a structured approach. Here's a detailed explanation along with the Verilog code for the module:

### Chain of Thought

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - The MAC module multiplies two 32-bit input operands `a` and `b`.
   - The result of the multiplication is accumulated in a register `c`.
   - The accumulator can be reset using the reset signal `rst`.
   - The operations are synchronized to the clock signal `clk`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Inputs:**
     - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronization.
     - `rst`: Reset signal to initialize the accumulator.
     - `a`, `b`: 32-bit operands for multiplication.
   - **Output:**
     - `c`: 32-bit output that holds the accumulated result.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - An intermediate signal for the product of `a` and `b`.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying all inputs and outputs.
   - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of `clk` or `rst`.
   - Inside the always block:
     - If `rst` is asserted, set `c` to zero.
     - If `rst` is deasserted, multiply `a` and `b`, then add the product to `c`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

Here's the complete Verilog code for the 32-bit MAC module, `pe`:

```verilog
module pe (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    input wire [31:0] a,
    input wire [31:0] b,
    output reg [31:0] c
);
    // Intermediate signal for the product of a and b
    wire [63:0] product;

    // Multiply a and b
    assign product = a * b;

    // MAC logic: Accumulate product into c or reset c
    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst)
            c <= 32'b0; // Reset c to zero
        else
            c <= c + product[31:0]; // Accumulate lower 32 bits of the product
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Product Calculation:** We multiply `a` and `b` and assign the result to a 64-bit wide wire `product`. This accounts for the potentially full width of the multiplication result.
- **Reset Functionality:** If `rst` is high, the accumulator `c` is reset to zero.
- **Accumulation Logic:** On each rising clock edge (if `rst` is not high), we add the lower 32 bits of the `product` to `c`. The lower 32 bits are selected because `c` is only 32 bits wide, ensuring the accumulator works within its intended range.
- **Synchronous Design:** The module's behavior is fully synchronized with the clock signal, making it suitable for reliable operation in digital systems.
