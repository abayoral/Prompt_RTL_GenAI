To create a Verilog module that replicates the functionality of the 7420 chip, we need to implement two 4-input NAND gates. Each gate will have four inputs and produce one output, which will be the NAND of its respective inputs.

Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
    - The 7420 chip contains two 4-input NAND gates.
    - For each gate, if any input is low (0), the output will be high (1), as the NAND gate produces a logical NOT of the AND of the inputs.
    - Inputs: Four for each NAND gate, a total of eight (p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d for the first gate; p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d for the second gate).
    - Outputs: One output for each NAND gate, a total of two (p1y, p2y).

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
    - Inputs: p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d
    - Outputs: p1y, p2y

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
    - No intermediate signals are required as we can directly compute the NAND operation using Verilog operators.

4. Structuring the Module:
    - Declare the module and specify its inputs and outputs.
    - Use the assign statement with logical operations to compute the NAND of the inputs. 

5. Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d,
    output wire p1y,
    input wire p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output wire p2y
);
    // NAND gate logic: Compute the NAND of the inputs for each gate
    assign p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);  // First 4-input NAND gate
    assign p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);  // Second 4-input NAND gate
endmodule
```

This module implements the functionality of two 4-input NAND gates as specified for the 7420 chip. Each output is the result of the NAND operation on its respective set of four inputs. The use of the logical AND (`&`) and NOT (`~`) operators allows us to create the NAND operation efficiently within a single assign statement for each gate.
