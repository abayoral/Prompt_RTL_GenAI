Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - The 7420 chip contains two 4-input NAND gates.
   - Each gate takes four input signals and produces an output which is the NAND of those four signals.
   - We need to create a module that has 8 inputs and 2 outputs.
   - The inputs can be grouped into two sets, each for one NAND gate.
   - The outputs will be driven by the NAND functionality of each set of inputs.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d` for the first gate, and `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d` for the second gate.
   - Outputs: `p1y` for the first NAND gate and `p2y` for the second NAND gate.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use two assign statements to define the outputs `p1y` and `p2y`.
   - Each assign statement should use the NAND operator (`~&`) to define the outputs based on the respective inputs.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d,
    output p1y,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output p2y );

    // NAND gate logic for p1y
    assign p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);

    // NAND gate logic for p2y
    assign p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);

endmodule
```

This Verilog module implements the functionality of the 7420 IC by creating two 4-input NAND gates. Each gate outputs the NAND of its four inputs.
