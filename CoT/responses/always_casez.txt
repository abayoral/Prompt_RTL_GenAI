Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        An 8-bit priority encoder reports the position of the first '1' bit in the 8-bit input vector. If no bits are '1', the output should be 0.
        Example: For 8'b10010000, the output should be 3'd4 as the first '1' is at the 4th bit.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: in[7:0]
        Output: pos[2:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed here.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use an always block, as the position value needs to be updated every time the input vector (in) changes.
        Inside the always block, calculate the position of the first '1' bit in the vector starting from bit[0] to bit[7].
        If none of the bits are '1', assign zero to the output.
 
Writing the Verilog Code:

    verilog

    module top_module (
        input [7:0] in,
        output reg [2:0] pos
    );
    
        always @* begin
            if (in[0]) pos = 3'b000;
            else if (in[1]) pos = 3'b001;
            else if (in[2]) pos = 3'b010;
            else if (in[3]) pos = 3'b011;
            else if (in[4]) pos = 3'b100;
            else if (in[5]) pos = 3'b101;
            else if (in[6]) pos = 3'b110;
            else if (in[7]) pos = 3'b111;
            else pos = 3'b000;
        end
        
    endmodule
