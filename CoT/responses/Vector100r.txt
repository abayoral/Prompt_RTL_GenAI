Chain of Thought:

Understand the Requirements:
- We have a 100-bit input vector (`in`) and need to reverse its bit order to produce the output vector (`out`).
- Reversing the bit order means that the least significant bit of `in` should become the most significant bit of `out`, and vice versa.

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- Input: `in[99:0]`
- Output: `out[99:0]`

Define Intermediate Signals:
- No intermediate signals are necessary as we can directly map input bits to output bits in reverse order.

Structuring the Module:
- Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
- Use an always block to implement the combinational logic for reversing the bit order.
- Use a for loop inside the always block to reverse the bits of the input vector and assign them to the output vector.

Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output reg [99:0] out
);
    // Combinational always block to reverse the bit order of the input vector
    always @(*) begin
        integer i;
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin
            out[i] = in[99 - i];
        end
    end
endmodule
```

In this implementation:
- The always block is triggered whenever any input changes (`@(*)`).
- We use a for loop to iterate over each bit position from 0 to 99.
- For each position `i`, we assign `in[99 - i]` to `out[i]`, effectively reversing the bit order.
