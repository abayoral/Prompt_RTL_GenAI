Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - A 2-to-1 multiplexer selects one of two inputs based on a control signal (`sel`) and outputs the selected input (`out`).
   - If `sel` is low (0), the output (`out`) should be the value of `a`.
   - If `sel` is high (1), the output (`out`) should be the value of `b`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `sel`
   - Output: `out`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed because the logic is straightforward and can be implemented directly in the assign statement.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an `assign` statement to define the output (`out`).
   - The assign statement uses a conditional (ternary) operator to set `out` based on the value of `sel`.
   - If `sel` is 1, `out` is assigned the value of `b`. If `sel` is 0, `out` is assigned the value of `a`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, b, sel,
    output out
); 
    // Multiplexer logic: out is b if sel is high, a if sel is low
    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;
endmodule
```

This module defines a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer using a conditional (ternary) operator for easy reading and efficient implementation.
