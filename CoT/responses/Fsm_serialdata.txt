Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need an FSM to identify the correct reception of a byte in a serial bitstream.
    - The data protocol consists of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit.
    - Once a byte is correctly received (validated by the stop bit), the byte should be outputted as `out_byte`, and a `done` signal should be asserted.
    - The serial protocol sends the least significant bit (LSB) first.

2. **FSM Implementation:**
    - We will create an FSM with the following states:
        - `IDLE`: Waiting for the start bit.
        - `START`: Validating the start bit.
        - `RECEIVE`: Receiving the 8 data bits.
        - `STOP`: Validating the stop bit and marking the reception as done.

3. **Datapath Implementation:**
    - A register needs to shift in one bit at a time to form the received byte.
    - When the stop bit is validated, this register will be presented as `out_byte`.

4. **Inputs and Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** `clk`, `in`, `reset`
    - **Outputs:** `out_byte`, `done`

5. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - `state`: Current state of FSM.
    - `next_state`: Next state of FSM.
    - `bit_count`: Counter to keep track of received bits.
    - `data_reg`: Register to store the received byte.

6. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Declare the module, inputs, and outputs.
    - Declare the state machine states.
    - Implement the FSM with an always block.
    - Implement the datapath to shift in bits and capture the byte.

7. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output reg [7:0] out_byte,
    output reg done
);

    // State declarations
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        IDLE = 2'b00,
        START = 2'b01,
        RECEIVE = 2'b10,
        STOP = 2'b11
    } state_t;
    
    state_t state, next_state;
    
    reg [7:0] data_reg;
    reg [2:0] bit_count;  // To count the received bits
    
    // FSM and control logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= IDLE;
            out_byte <= 8'd0;
            done <= 0;
            data_reg <= 8'd0;
            bit_count <= 3'd0;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;

            // Output and intermediate signal updates
            case (state)
                IDLE: begin
                    done <= 0;
                    if (in == 0)  // Detected start bit
                        next_state <= START;
                    else
                        next_state <= IDLE;
                end

                START: begin
                    bit_count <= 3'd0;
                    data_reg <= 8'd0;
                    next_state <= RECEIVE;
                end

                RECEIVE: begin
                    data_reg[bit_count] <= in;
                    bit_count <= bit_count + 1;

                    if (bit_count == 3'd7)  // All 8 bits received
                        next_state <= STOP;
                    else
                        next_state <= RECEIVE;
                end

                STOP: begin
                    if (in == 1) begin  // Stop bit is correct
                        out_byte <= data_reg;
                        done <= 1;
                        next_state <= IDLE;
                    end else begin  // Stop bit is incorrect, wait for next stop bit
                        next_state <= STOP;
                    end
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

The above Verilog module implements an FSM to track the reception of a byte in a serial bitstream, verifying the start bit, data bits, and stop bit. It also includes a datapath that shifts in the serial data and outputs the byte once fully received and validated.
