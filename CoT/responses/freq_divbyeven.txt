Certainly! Let's go through the chain of thought for designing the `freq_diveven` module, which is a frequency divider that divides the input clock by an even number specified by a parameter `NUM_DIV`.

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - The module divides the input clock frequency by an even number specified by the parameter `NUM_DIV`.
    - This means the `clk_div` toggles after every `NUM_DIV` cycles of the input `clk`.
    - An active-low reset (`rst_n`) is used to initialize the internal states, i.e., the counter and the divided clock output.

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**: `clk` (input clock), `rst_n` (active-low reset)
    - **Output**: `clk_div` (divided clock output)

3. **Parameter**:
    - `NUM_DIV` is an even number which dictates the division factor for the clock.

4. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - A 4-bit counter (`cnt`) is required to track the clock cycles.
    - This counter should count up to `NUM_DIV / 2 - 1` and then reset.

5. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration including inputs, outputs, and the parameter.
    - Use a procedural block (always block) sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the negative edge of `rst_n`.
    - If `rst_n` is low, reset the counter and `clk_div`.
    - If the counter reaches `NUM_DIV / 2 - 1`, toggle `clk_div` and reset the counter.
    - Otherwise, increment the counter.

6. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

Here's the implementation of the module:

```verilog
module freq_diveven #(parameter NUM_DIV = 4) (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    output reg clk_div
);
    // Ensure NUM_DIV is even
    initial begin
        if (NUM_DIV % 2 != 0) begin
            $display("Error: NUM_DIV must be even.");
            $stop;
        end
    end

    // Counter to track clock cycles
    reg [3:0] cnt;

    // Frequency divider logic
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            cnt <= 4'b0000;
            clk_div <= 1'b0;
        end else if (cnt == (NUM_DIV / 2) - 1) begin
            cnt <= 4'b0000;
            clk_div <= ~clk_div;
        end else begin
            cnt <= cnt + 1'b1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Initial Block**: We have an initial block to ensure `NUM_DIV` is indeed an even number. If not, an error message is displayed and simulation stops.
  
- **Flip-Flop Behavior**: The `always` block is sensitive to `posedge clk` and `negedge rst_n`, ensuring that asynchronous reset logic is respected.

- **Counter**: `cnt` is a 4-bit counter because it needs to store values from 0 up to a maximum NUM_DIV/2 - 1, which is well within a 4-bit range.

- **Frequency Division Logic**:
  - When `rst_n` is low, both `cnt` and `clk_div` are reset.
  - If `cnt` reaches the equivalent of `NUM_DIV/2 - 1`, the module resets `cnt` and toggles `clk_div`.
  - Otherwise, `cnt` is incremented on each clock cycle.

This module divides the input clock by an even factor, specified by `NUM_DIV`, and accurately toggles the divided clock output `clk_div`.
