Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
    - The module has three inputs: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    - The module has four outputs: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
    - The following connections are to be made:
        - `a` -> `w`
        - `b` -> `x`
        - `b` -> `y`
        - `c` -> `z`
    - Essentially, the outputs will directly connect to the specified inputs.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`
    - Outputs: `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
    - No intermediate signals are needed. The connections are straightforward and can be directly assigned.

4. Structuring the Module:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use assign statements to directly connect each output to its corresponding input.
    
5. Writing the Verilog Code:
    - The logic involves direct assignment of outputs to the specified inputs.

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, b, c,
    output w, x, y, z
);
    // Direct connections based on the given requirements
    assign w = a;
    assign x = b;
    assign y = b;
    assign z = c;
endmodule
```

This Verilog module declares the inputs and outputs, and uses assign statements to directly connect the inputs to the corresponding outputs as specified.
