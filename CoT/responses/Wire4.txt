Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - The task is to create a Verilog module with three inputs and four outputs.
   - Each output needs to correspond to one or more of the inputs directly as if they are connected by wires.
   - The specific connections are:
     - `a` is connected to `w`
     - `b` is connected to `x`
     - `b` is also connected to `y`
     - `c` is connected to `z`

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`
   - Outputs: `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed as the task is a direct wire-style connection.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Declare the module, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use assign statements to map each input to the corresponding output(s).
   - The use of the concatenation operator (`{}`) is not needed, as direct assignments suffice here.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output w,
    output x,
    output y,
    output z
);
    // Wire-style connections
    assign w = a; // Connect a to w
    assign x = b; // Connect b to x
    assign y = b; // Connect b to y (duplicate connection of b)
    assign z = c; // Connect c to z
endmodule
```

This code effectively creates the desired connections directly between the inputs and outputs, emulating simple wiring within the module.
