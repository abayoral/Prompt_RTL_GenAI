Let's dive into designing a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a combination of both positive-edge and negative-edge triggered flip-flops. The idea is to create two flip-flops, one triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the other by the negative edge. We then use a selector to choose the correct value based on the clock edge.

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to create a flip-flop that reacts to both the positive and negative edges of the clock signal.
    - FPGAs do not support dual-edge triggered flip-flops directly.
    - The solution must work around this limitation using available resources.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** `clk`, `d`
    - **Output:** `q`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - We need two internal signals to store the data captured by the flip-flops at the positive and negative edges of the clock.
    - An internal signal can be used to toggle between these two captured values based on the clock edge.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Use two always blocks: one triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the other by the negative edge.
    - Each always block will update its respective internal signal with the value of the data input `d`.
    - Use a selector to output the correct value between the two internal signals.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire d,
    output reg q
);

    // Intermediate signals for storing values at different clock edges
    reg q_posedge; // Value at positive edge of the clock
    reg q_negedge; // Value at negative edge of the clock

    // Process for the positive edge of the clock
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_posedge <= d;
    end

    // Process for the negative edge of the clock
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_negedge <= d;
    end

    // Select the appropriate value of q based on clock edge
    always @(*) begin
        if (clk)
            q = q_negedge; // Use the value captured at the negative edge
        else
            q = q_posedge; // Use the value captured at the positive edge
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Intermediate Signals:**
  - `q_posedge`: stores the value of `d` at the positive edge of the clock.
  - `q_negedge`: stores the value of `d` at the negative edge of the clock.
- **Always Blocks:**
  - The first always block captures the value of `d` when there is a positive edge on `clk`.
  - The second always block captures the value of `d` when there is a negative edge on `clk`.
- **Output Logic:**
  - We then use an always block with a combinational sensitivity list to assign the output `q`. This block decides which internal signal to output based on the current value of `clk`:
    - If `clk` is high, we output `q_negedge`.
    - If `clk` is low, we output `q_posedge`.

This way, we emulate a dual-edge triggered flip-flop by combining the functionality of two single-edge triggered flip-flops.
