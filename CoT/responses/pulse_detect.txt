To design the `pulse_detect` module according to the specified requirements, we need to create a state machine with distinct states to monitor and identify the pattern in the `data_in` signal. Here is the step-by-step design process and the resulting Verilog code:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**: We need to detect a specific pattern where `data_in` transitions from 0 to 1 to 0 over three clock cycles. When this sequence is detected, `data_out` should briefly indicate detection by being high for one cycle.

2. **Define the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Inputs: `clk`, `rst_n`, `data_in`
   - Output: `data_out`

3. **Define the Internal State**:
   - We'll use a register `state` to track the pulse detection progress. The state could have the following states:
     - `IDLE`: Waiting for `0 -> 1` transition.
     - `PULSE_START`: Detected `0 -> 1`.
     - `PULSE_END`: Detected `0 -> 1 -> 0` and should set `data_out` to high.

4. **State Transitions**:
   - From `IDLE`, transition to `PULSE_START` when `data_in` is 1.
   - From `PULSE_START`, transition to `PULSE_END` when `data_in` returns to 0.
   - From `PULSE_END`, after setting `data_out` to 1 for one cycle, transition back to `IDLE`.

5. **Reset Logic**:
   - When `rst_n` is low, reset the state to `IDLE` and ensure `data_out` is 0.

6. **Output Logic**:
   - The output `data_out` is set to 1 only in the `PULSE_END` state to indicate the detection of the pulse.

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
module pulse_detect (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire data_in,
    output reg data_out
);

    // State Definitions
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        IDLE = 2'b00,
        PULSE_START = 2'b01,
        PULSE_END = 2'b10
    } state_t;
    
    state_t state, next_state;

    // State Transition Logic
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            state <= IDLE;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next State and Output Logic
    always @(*) begin
        next_state = state;
        data_out = 1'b0; // Default output is 0 unless pulse is detected
        
        case (state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (data_in == 1'b1) begin
                    next_state = PULSE_START;
                end
            end
            
            PULSE_START: begin
                if (data_in == 1'b0) begin
                    next_state = PULSE_END;
                end
            end
            
            PULSE_END: begin
                data_out = 1'b1; // Signal detected pulse for one cycle
                next_state = IDLE; // Return to IDLE after one cycle
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Definitions**: We defined an enumerated type `state_t` with three states using a 2-bit width to represent the different stages in pulse detection.
  
- **State Transition Logic**: An always block triggered on the clock's positive edge or the reset's negative edge to manage the state transitions. When reset, the state goes to `IDLE`.

- **Next State and Output Logic**: Another always block that calculates the next state and output based on the current state and input conditions. This block ensures the pulse is only detected upon successfully recognizing the `0 -> 1 -> 0` pattern.

- **Output**: Ensures `data_out` is asserted for one clock cycle only upon detecting a complete pulse pattern. Afterward, the state transitions back to prepare for the next possible pulse.
