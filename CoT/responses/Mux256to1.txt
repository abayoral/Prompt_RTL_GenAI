### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.
   - We have a packed single 256-bit input vector (`in`).
   - There is an 8-bit select input (`sel`) that determines which of the 256 input bits to output (`out`).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Input:** `in` (256 bits), `sel` (8 bits)
   - **Output:** `out` (1 bit)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are required as we can directly use the select input to index into the `in` vector.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an `assign` statement to map the output (`out`) to a specific bit of the input vector (`in`) based on the value of the select input (`sel`).
   - Vector indices can be variable, and this approach will allow us to directly select one bit from the 256-bit `in` vector using `sel`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [255:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output out 
);

    // Multiplexer logic: Select the bit from 'in' based on 'sel'
    assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```
