Chain of Thought:

Understand the Requirements:
A 4-digit BCD counter counts from 0000 to 9999 (in decimal) where each BCD digit is encoded using 4 bits. The BCD counter increments its value on each rising edge of the clock (clk).
The counter resets to 0000 when the reset (reset) signal is high.
The enable signals ena[3] to ena[1] are asserted high when the respective BCD digit should be incremented.
Inputs: clk, reset
Outputs: ena[3:1], q[15:0]

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
Inputs: clk, reset
Output: ena[3:1], q[15:0]

Define Intermediate Signals:
Intermediate signals count[3:0] are used to hold the value of each BCD digit.

Structuring the Module:

Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
Define four instances of a single BCD counter for each digit.
Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock or the rising edge of the reset signal.
Inside the always block, if the reset signal is high, assign zero to all BCD digits.
If the reset signal is low, increment the value of each BCD digit when its corresponding enable signal is asserted.
Assign the value of each BCD digit to the corresponding part of the output q[15:0].

Writing the Verilog Code:

verilog

module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output wire [3:1] ena,
    output reg [15:0] q
);
    reg [3:0] count [0:3];
    
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            q <= 16'b0000000000000000;
        else begin
            if (ena[1]) count[1] <= count[1] + 1;
            if (ena[2]) count[2] <= count[2] + 1;
            if (ena[3]) count[3] <= count[3] + 1;
        end
    end
    
    assign q[3:0] = count[0];
    assign q[7:4] = count[1];
    assign q[11:8] = count[2];
    assign q[15:12] = count[3];
endmodule

Please note that you need to be careful with 4-bit BCD digit, because it must not exceed 9. The increment logic should be built properly, if the count value is 9, next increment should make it 0 and carry to the next digit.
