Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - An 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer selects one of two 8-bit inputs (`a` or `b`) based on a control signal (`sel`) and outputs the selected input (`out`).
    - If `sel` is high (1), the output should be the value of `b`.
    - If `sel` is low (0), the output should be the value of `a`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `sel`, `a[7:0]`, `b[7:0]`
    - Output: `out[7:0]`

3. **Identify Issues in the Given Code:**
    - The output `out` should be an 8-bit wide vector, but it is declared as a single bit.
    - The logic operation used is correct in principle, but it needs to be adjusted for an 8-bit wide vector.

4. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are needed; we can directly use a conditional (ternary) operator in the `assign` statement.

5. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs with correct bit widths.
    - Use a correct `assign` statement to implement the multiplexer logic.

6. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire sel,
    input wire [7:0] a,
    input wire [7:0] b,
    output wire [7:0] out
);
    // Multiplexer logic: out is b if sel is high, a if sel is low
    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- The output `out` is declared as an 8-bit wide vector (`[7:0]`).
- The `assign` statement uses the conditional (ternary) operator to select between `a` and `b` based on the value of `sel`.
- If `sel` is 1, `out` is assigned the value of `b`.
- If `sel` is 0, `out` is assigned the value of `a`.
