Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - A 100-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer must be created.
   - It has two 100-bit inputs: `a` and `b`.
   - It has a single 1-bit select input: `sel`.
   - The output, `out`, is also 100 bits wide.
   - If `sel` is 0, `out` should be equal to `a`.
   - If `sel` is 1, `out` should be equal to `b`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a[99:0]`, `b[99:0]`, `sel`
   - Output: `out[99:0]`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying inputs and outputs.
   - Use an `assign` statement to define the logic for the output `out`.
   - The assign statement will use the conditional (ternary) operator to select between `a` and `b` based on `sel`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input wire [99:0] a, 
    input wire [99:0] b,
    input wire sel,
    output wire [99:0] out
);
    // Multiplexer logic: out is b if sel is high, a if sel is low
    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;
endmodule
```

This Verilog module implements a 100-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer using the ternary operator to select between inputs `a` and `b` based on the value of the `sel` input.
