Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to generate three output vectors (`out_both`, `out_any`, `out_different`) based on the provided 100-bit input vector (`in`).
    - `out_both`: Indicates whether both the corresponding input bit and its left neighbor are '1'. The output will be 99 bits (`out_both[98:0]`).
    - `out_any`: Indicates whether any of the corresponding input bit and its right neighbor are '1'. The output will be 99 bits (`out_any[99:1]`).
    - `out_different`: Indicates whether the corresponding input bit is different from its left neighbor. The output will be 100 bits (`out_different[99:0]`), considering wrapping around.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Input: `in[99:0]`
    - Outputs: `out_both[98:0]`, `out_any[99:1]`, `out_different[99:0]`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals needed, only straightforward bitwise operations using shift operations.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - The module declaration will specify one input vector and three output vectors.
    - Use assign statements to generate each output vector:
      - `out_both` can be generated by performing a bitwise AND operation on `in[99:1]` and `in[98:0]`.
      - `out_any` can be generated by performing a bitwise OR operation on `in[98:0]` and `in[99:1]`.
      - `out_different` can be generated by performing a bitwise XOR operation on `in` and `in` shifted left by one bit, with wrapping around using concatenation.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**
```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output [98:0] out_both,
    output [99:1] out_any,
    output [99:0] out_different );

    // out_both: Both in[i] and in[i+1] should be '1'
    assign out_both = in[99:1] & in[98:0];

    // out_any: Either in[i] or in[i-1] should be '1'
    assign out_any = in[98:0] | in[99:1];

    // out_different: in[i] should be different from in[i+1]
    assign out_different = in ^ {in[0], in[99:1]};

endmodule
```

This code meets the requirements efficiently using three assign statements and correctly generates each specified output vector.
