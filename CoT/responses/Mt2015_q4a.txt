Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
   - We need to implement a function where the output z is determined by the expression z = (x ^ y) & x.
   - This means we first perform a bitwise XOR operation between the inputs x and y.
   - Then, we perform a bitwise AND operation between the result of the XOR and the input x.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
   - Inputs: x, y (both are single-bit inputs as inferred from the context).
   - Output: z

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
   - An intermediate signal can be used to store the result of the XOR operation for clarity, though it is not strictly necessary.

4. Structuring the Module:
   - Begin with the module declaration, including the inputs and outputs.
   - Use the assign statement to define the output z using the required expression.
   - First calculate the XOR of x and y, then AND the result with x.

5. Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire x,
    input wire y,
    output wire z
);
    // XOR the inputs x and y
    wire intermediate_result;
    assign intermediate_result = x ^ y;

    // AND the intermediate result with x to get z
    assign z = intermediate_result & x;
endmodule
```

This module correctly implements the functionality `z = (x ^ y) & x` using both an intermediate signal and straightforward assign statements.
