## Chain of Thought:

### Understand the Requirements:
A half adder adds two single-bit binary numbers `a` and `b` and produces a `sum` and a `carry-out`. Specifically, the half adder results in:
- `sum` = `a` XOR `b`
- `carry-out` (`cout`) = `a` AND `b`

### Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- Inputs: `a`, `b`
- Outputs: `cout`, `sum`

### Define Intermediate Signals:
No intermediate signals are needed as the logic can be directly implemented using basic logic gates (XOR and AND).

### Structuring the Module:
Let's start with the module declaration. The `sum` can be derived from the XOR operation between `a` and `b`. The carry-out (`cout`) is the AND operation between `a` and `b`.

### Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input wire a, 
    input wire b,
    output wire cout, 
    output wire sum 
);
    // Sum is a XOR b
    assign sum = a ^ b;
    // Carry-out is a AND b
    assign cout = a & b;
endmodule
```

This module defines the half adder as required, with the correct logic to produce the `sum` and `cout` signals.
