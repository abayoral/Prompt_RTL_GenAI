To create a Verilog module for converting 4-bit parallel data into serial format, we'll follow the defined requirements and ensure that the serial output and valid signals are correctly implemented. Here's the thought process and corresponding Verilog code:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand Requirements:**
   - Inputs: `clk`, `rst_n`, `d[3:0]`
   - Outputs: `valid_out`, `dout`
   - Functionality: Convert 4-bit parallel input (`d`) to serial output (`dout`) starting with MSB and ending with LSB.
   - Use a counter (`cnt`) to track the bit being output (ranging from 0 to 3).

2. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Clock (`clk`) for synchronization.
   - Active-low reset (`rst_n`) for initializing/resetting.
   - 4-bit parallel data input (`d`).
   - Single-bit serial output (`dout`).
   - `valid_out` indicating data availability during serial transmission.

3. **Operational Logic:**
   - Use a 2-bit counter (`cnt`) to determine which bit of `d` to output.
   - On each clock cycle, `dout` outputs the current bit of `d` as determined by the value of `cnt`.
   - `valid_out` should be asserted high during the transmission of all bits (i.e., for values of `cnt` from 0 to 3).

4. **Reset and Counter Logic:**
   - On reset (`rst_n` low): Initialize `cnt` to 0 and ensure a known state.
   - During normal operation (`rst_n` high), increment `cnt` on each clock edge until all bits are output, then reset `cnt` to 0.

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
module parallel2serial (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire [3:0] d,
    output reg valid_out,
    output reg dout
);
    // 2-bit counter to manage the bit selection
    reg [1:0] cnt;

    // Sequential logic for parallel-to-serial conversion
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            // Reset: Initialize counter and outputs
            cnt <= 2'b00;
            dout <= 1'b0;
            valid_out <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            // Output the current bit determined by the counter
            dout <= d[3 - cnt];
            valid_out <= 1'b1;

            // Increment counter and wrap around after 4 bits
            if (cnt == 2'b11) begin
                cnt <= 2'b00;
            end else begin
                cnt <= cnt + 1;
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Counter Logic:** The 2-bit counter `cnt` is used to select the appropriate bit from `d` (starting from the MSB, `d[3]`, down to the LSB, `d[0]`).
- **Reset Condition:** When `rst_n` is low, `cnt`, `dout`, and `valid_out` are reset to prepare the module for a fresh input sequence.
- **Output Logic:** `dout` outputs the bit of `d` indexed by `3 - cnt`, ensuring MSB-first output. `valid_out` is set high whenever `dout` is valid, across the 4-bit transmission.
- **Normal Operation:** On each clock cycle, `cnt` is incremented, cycling through each bit index from 0 to 3. Upon reaching the last bit, `cnt` resets to zero to prepare for the next conversion cycle.
