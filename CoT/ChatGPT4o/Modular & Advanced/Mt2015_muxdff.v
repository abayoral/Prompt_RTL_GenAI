// you're a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company tasked with developing a critical Verilog module for a next-generation product. The success of this module is pivotal for maintaining my computer hardware company's reputation in the industry.

// Assume that you want to implement hierarchical Verilog code for a sequential circuit, using three instantiations of a submodule that has a flip-flop and multiplexer in it. Write a Verilog module (containing one flip-flop and multiplexer) named top_module for this submodule.

module top_module (
	input clk,
	input L,
	input r_in,
	input q_in,
	output reg Q);

	// Insert your code here

endmodule
