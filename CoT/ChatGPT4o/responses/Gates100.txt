To address the task of creating a combinational circuit with 100 inputs and three types of outputs (AND, OR, XOR), we can utilize Verilog's reduction operators. These operators are particularly efficient for this task as they can apply a logical operator across all bits of a vector.

Here's the step-by-step thought process and implementation:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need a module that takes a 100-bit vector as input.
   - The module should produce three outputs: 
     - `out_and`: Result of applying AND operation across all 100 bits.
     - `out_or`: Result of applying OR operation across all 100 bits.
     - `out_xor`: Result of applying XOR operation across all 100 bits.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Input: `in[99:0]`
   - Outputs: `out_and`, `out_or`, `out_xor`

3. **Utilize Verilog Reduction Operators:**
   - The reduction AND operator `&` will be used for `out_and`.
   - The reduction OR operator `|` will be used for `out_or`.
   - The reduction XOR operator `^` will be used for `out_xor`.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Use the module declaration to specify inputs and outputs.
   - Use assign statements to define the logic for each output based on the reduction operators applied to the input vector.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor 
);
    // Apply reduction AND operator to calculate out_and
    assign out_and = &in;
    
    // Apply reduction OR operator to calculate out_or
    assign out_or = |in;
    
    // Apply reduction XOR operator to calculate out_xor
    assign out_xor = ^in;
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Reduction Operators:**
  - `&in`: Performs an AND operation between all bits in the vector `in[99:0]`, producing a single-bit result.
  - `|in`: Performs an OR operation between all bits, resulting in a single-bit output.
  - `^in`: Computes the XOR operation across all bits, leading to a single-bit output.
  
This code efficiently implements the required combinational logic using reduction operators, ensuring that the module is both concise and performant.
