To implement the XOR gate using three different methods in Verilog, we can follow this thought process:

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to implement an XOR gate using three different approaches within the same module: 
     1. Using an assign statement.
     2. Using a combinational always block.
     3. Using a clocked always block triggered by a clock signal (`clk`).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a`, `b` (the two inputs for the XOR operation), and `clk` (for the clocked logic).
   - Outputs: `out_assign`, `out_always_comb`, `out_always_ff` corresponding to each implementation method.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed since the XOR operation is straightforward.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - The module contains three sections: one for the `assign` statement, one for the combinational logic using an `always` block, and one for the clocked logic using another `always` block triggered on the rising edge of `clk`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module(
    input wire clk,
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always_comb,
    output reg out_always_ff
);

    // XOR using assign statement
    assign out_assign = a ^ b;

    // XOR using combinational always block
    always @* begin
        out_always_comb = a ^ b;
    end

    // XOR using clocked always block
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out_always_ff <= a ^ b;
    end

endmodule
```

- **Assign Statement:** Directly use the bitwise XOR operator `^` to perform the XOR operation.
- **Combinational Always Block:** Use the `always @*` block to describe combinational logic, ensuring that `out_always_comb` gets the result of the XOR operation whenever `a` or `b` changes.
- **Clocked Always Block:** Use `always @(posedge clk)` to implement the XOR logic within a clocked sequential block, ensuring that `out_always_ff` updates its value at each rising edge of `clk`. 

This implementation ensures that the XOR functionality is correctly realized through three different methods, showcasing various approaches to combinational and sequential logic in Verilog.
