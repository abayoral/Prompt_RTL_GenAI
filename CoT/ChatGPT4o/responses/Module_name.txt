To correctly connect the ports of `mod_a` to the `top_module`, we can use named port connections in the instantiation of `mod_a`. The named port connection ensures that each port of `mod_a` is connected to the correct corresponding port in the `top_module`. Here is how the solution should be implemented:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

    // Instantiate mod_a with named port connections
    mod_a instance_name (
        .out1(out1),  // Connect top_module's out1 to mod_a's out1
        .out2(out2),  // Connect top_module's out2 to mod_a's out2
        .in1(a),      // Connect top_module's a to mod_a's in1
        .in2(b),      // Connect top_module's b to mod_a's in2
        .in3(c),      // Connect top_module's c to mod_a's in3
        .in4(d)       // Connect top_module's d to mod_a's in4
    );

endmodule
```

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to connect the ports of the internal module (`mod_a`) to the top-level module (`top_module`) based on the specified mapping.
    - The mapping for port connections is explicitly given.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs to `top_module`: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`
    - Outputs from `top_module`: `out1`, `out2`
    - Correspondence:
      - `out1` in `mod_a` to `out1` in `top_module`
      - `out2` in `mod_a` to `out2` in `top_module`
      - `in1` in `mod_a` to `a` in `top_module`
      - `in2` in `mod_a` to `b` in `top_module`
      - `in3` in `mod_a` to `c` in `top_module`
      - `in4` in `mod_a` to `d` in `top_module`

3. **Use Named Port Mapping:**
    - Named port mapping makes it easy to see which port in the instantiated module connects to which signal.
    - This is especially useful here given the predefined connections that must be maintained.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
    - Instantiate `mod_a` within `top_module` using named port connections.
    - Ensure each port of `mod_a` is correctly mapped to the appropriate signal in `top_module`. 

This implementation ensures that the signals are connected correctly and makes the code easy to understand and maintain.
