To implement a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer, we will use a case statement to choose the correct input based on the value of the select signal (`sel`). If `sel` is between 9 and 15 (inclusive), we set all output bits to '1'. Below is the structured plan and implementation in Verilog.

### Chain of Thought

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - The module is a multiplexer with 9 data inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`.
    - Each input is 16 bits wide.
    - The select input (`sel`) determines which of the inputs is routed to the output.
    - If `sel` is between 0 and 8, the output should be the corresponding input.
    - If `sel` is between 9 and 15, the output should be all 1s, represented by `16'b1111111111111111`.

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i` (each 16 bits), and `sel` (4 bits).
    - Output: `out` (16 bits).

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - We will use a `reg [15:0]` type for the output inside an always block since we'll be assigning the output based on a case statement.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block with a case statement to handle the different values of `sel`.
    - Inside the case statement, assign the output to the corresponding input for `sel` values from 0 to 8.
    - For `sel` values between 9 and 15, assign `16'b1111111111111111` to the output.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [15:0] a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,
    input [3:0] sel,
    output reg [15:0] out
);
    // Multiplexer logic using a case statement
    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            4'b0000: out = a;
            4'b0001: out = b;
            4'b0010: out = c;
            4'b0011: out = d;
            4'b0100: out = e;
            4'b0101: out = f;
            4'b0110: out = g;
            4'b0111: out = h;
            4'b1000: out = i;
            default: out = 16'b1111111111111111; // Unused cases: sel = 9 to 15
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

This code uses a case statement to implement the multiplexer logic efficiently, ensuring that all inputs are correctly routed based on the select signal and defaulting to the all 1s state when `sel` is outside the range of valid inputs.
