To design this finite state machine (FSM) for identifying message boundaries in the PS/2 mouse protocol, we will analyze and outline the states first:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
    - We need to detect the start of a message and indicate when a full message (3 bytes) has been received.
    - The first byte of a message is identified by in[3] being 1.
    - After identifying the first byte, we must track two additional bytes to complete the message.

2. **Define the States**:
    - **IDLE**: Wait for in[3] to be high to detect the start of a message.
    - **BYTE1**: Detected the start of a message; waiting for the second byte.
    - **BYTE2**: Received the second byte; waiting for the third byte.
    - **DONE**: Received all three bytes of the message; assert done.

3. **Determine Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `clk`, `in[7:0]` (though we only use `in[3]`), `reset`.
    - Output: `done` (asserted for one cycle after the third byte).

4. **Structure the Module**:
    - Use an enumerated state definition for clarity and readability.
    - Use an always block to handle state transitions on the rising edge of `clk`.
    - Implement logic to assert `done` in the `DONE` state and reset it otherwise.

5. **Implementation Details**:
    - Use a synchronous reset.
    - Return to `IDLE` after signaling `done`.

### Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output reg done // Register to hold the done signal
);

    // State definitions
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        IDLE  = 2'b00,
        BYTE1 = 2'b01,
        BYTE2 = 2'b10,
        DONE  = 2'b11
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic (combinational)
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in[3] == 1'b1)
                    next_state = BYTE1;
                else
                    next_state = IDLE;
            end
            BYTE1: begin
                next_state = BYTE2;
            end
            BYTE2: begin
                next_state = DONE;
            end
            DONE: begin
                next_state = IDLE;
            end
            default: begin
                next_state = IDLE;
            end
        endcase
    end

    // State flip-flops (sequential)
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= IDLE;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // Output logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            done <= 1'b0;
        else if (current_state == DONE)
            done <= 1'b1;
        else
            done <= 1'b0;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- We used a 2-bit `state_t` type for state enumeration, which enhances readability.
- The `always` block responds to rising edges of `clk` and processes state transitions based on `next_state`.
- The `done` signal is set when the FSM enters the `DONE` state and is reset on all other states or when `reset` is asserted.
- This FSM waits for `in[3]` to indicate a message start in the `IDLE` state. After capturing this first byte, it proceeds through `BYTE1` and `BYTE2`, and then signals `done` in the `DONE` state.
