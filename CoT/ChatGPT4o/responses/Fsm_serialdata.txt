To tackle this problem, we need to develop a finite state machine (FSM) that manages the reception of bytes from a serial bitstream. The FSM must detect the start bit, collect 8 data bits in the correct order, verify the stop bit, and then output the correctly received byte when complete. The serial protocol we're working with transmits the least significant bit (LSB) first. The Verilog code below reveals the thought process and implementation for such a system.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need an FSM that identifies start, stop, and data bits in a serial bitstream.
   - Serial data comes in LSB first.
   - Output the full byte when received correctly, along with a valid “done” signal.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk`, `in`, `reset`.
   - Outputs: `out_byte` (8-bit data), `done` (indicating valid data output).

3. **FSM Design:**
   - States: Idle (wait for start bit), Data (shift in 8 data bits), Check (verify stop bit).
   - Transition: From Idle to Data on receiving a start bit (usually '0'). From Data to Check after receiving 8 bits. From Check back to Idle if stop bit is correct, otherwise keep checking.

4. **Datapath Design:**
   - Shift register will store the 8 received data bits.
   - Output control: `out_byte` should be valid when the `done` signal is high.

5. **Intermediate Signals:**
   - `shift_reg` to hold the 8 bits temporarily.
   - Counter to track the number of bits shifted.

6. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Use an always block for the FSM.
   - Use combinational logic to determine state transitions based on inputs.
   - Capture data bits using a shift register within the FSM’s data state.

7. **Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output reg [7:0] out_byte,
    output reg done
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        IDLE   = 2'b00,
        DATA   = 2'b01,
        CHECK  = 2'b10
    } state_t;

    state_t state, next_state;
    reg [7:0] shift_reg;
    reg [2:0] count; // Counts the 8 data bits

    // State transitions
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= IDLE;
            count <= 3'b000;
            shift_reg <= 8'b0;
            done <= 0;
        end
        else begin
            state <= next_state;
            if (state == DATA) begin
                shift_reg <= {in, shift_reg[7:1]};
                if (count < 3'd7)
                    count <= count + 1'b1;
                else
                    count <= 3'b000;
            end
            else begin
                count <= 3'b000;
                shift_reg <= shift_reg;
            end
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            IDLE: begin
                done = 0;
                if (in == 1'b0) // Start bit detected
                    next_state = DATA;
                else
                    next_state = IDLE;
            end
            DATA: begin
                done = 0;
                if (count == 3'd7)
                    next_state = CHECK;
                else
                    next_state = DATA;
            end
            CHECK: begin
                if (in == 1'b1) begin // Stop bit should be 1
                    done = 1;
                    out_byte = shift_reg;
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end
                else begin
                    done = 0;
                    next_state = CHECK; // Stay until the correct stop bit is detected
                end
            end
            default: begin
                next_state = IDLE;
                done = 0;
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the FSM starts in the `IDLE` state and waits for a start bit. Once the start bit is detected, it transitions to the `DATA` state, shifting in bits into a register. After receiving 8 bits, the FSM checks for the correct stop bit in the `CHECK` state. If correct, the data is output, and the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state. If not, it remains in the `CHECK` state until the stop bit is validated. The received byte is available at `out_byte` when `done` is asserted.
