Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to design a priority encoder for an 8-bit input vector.
   - The encoder should output the position of the first (least significant) '1' encountered in the input vector.
   - If there are no '1's in the input, the output should be zero.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Input: `in` which is an 8-bit vector.
   - Output: `pos`, a 3-bit vector representing the position of the first '1' (or '0' if none).

3. **Define the Logic:**
   - Loop through the bits of the input vector starting from the least significant bit.
   - Check each bit to see if it is '1'.
   - Assign the position to `pos` of that bit if it is '1'.
   - If no bits are '1', `pos` should remain set to zero.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Begin with the module declaration and specify inputs/outputs.
   - Use an always block to check the conditions and update `pos`.
   - Prioritize detection from the least significant bit since that's the requirement.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [2:0] pos
);

    // Priority encoder logic
    always @(*) begin
        casez (in) // Use casez to handle don't cares (z) gracefully
            8'b00000001: pos = 3'd0;
            8'b0000001?: pos = 3'd1;
            8'b000001??: pos = 3'd2;
            8'b00001???: pos = 3'd3;
            8'b0001????: pos = 3'd4;
            8'b001?????: pos = 3'd5;
            8'b01??????: pos = 3'd6;
            8'b1???????: pos = 3'd7;
            default: pos = 3'd0; // Default case when no bits are '1'
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the `casez` statement allows us to efficiently prioritize the bits using wildcard matching ('?') while ensuring that the most significant position of the '1' is accurately determined. The `default` ensures that `pos` is set to `0` if there are no '1's in `in`. This fulfills the requirement to identify the first '1' from the least significant side of the vector.
