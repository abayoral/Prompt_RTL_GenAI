To implement the requested module using both an assign statement and a combinational always block, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - An AND gate performs a logical AND operation on its inputs.
   - We need to generate two outputs for the same AND operation using different Verilog constructs:
      - `out_assign` using an assign statement.
      - `out_alwaysblock` using a combinational always block.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a`, `b` (both 1-bit)
   - Outputs: `out_assign`, `out_alwaysblock` (both 1-bit)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed as the logic is straightforward.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start the module definition with inputs and outputs. 
   - Use an assign statement to compute `out_assign` as the logical AND of `a` and `b`.
   - Use a combinational always block to compute `out_alwaysblock` as the logical AND of `a` and `b`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_alwaysblock
);

    // Assign statement: computes the AND operation
    assign out_assign = a & b;

    // Combinational always block: computes the AND operation
    always @(*) begin
        out_alwaysblock = a & b;
    end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- The `assign out_assign = a & b;` line uses an assign statement to continuously assign the result of the logical AND operation between `a` and `b` to `out_assign`.
- The combinational `always @(*)` block calculates `out_alwaysblock` using the inputs `a` and `b`, ensuring that `out_alwaysblock` is always updated whenever any of its inputs change. This construct is useful in more complex situations, but here it serves the purpose of demonstration as requested.
