To build the decade counter with enable control and synchronous reset, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - The decade counter should count from 0 to 9 (inclusive), with the counting attribute selected by `slowena`.
    - The counter has a synchronous reset, which means the counter will reset to 0 when `reset` is active during the clock edge.
    - The `slowena` signal determines whether the counter should increment on a clock cycle.
    - The output `q` represents the current count as a 4-bit signal.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `clk` (clock), `slowena` (enable signal), `reset` (synchronous reset)
    - Output: `q` (4-bit output representing the counter value)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are needed for this straightforward implementation. The state of the counter is maintained directly in the output register `q`.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, listing the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an `always` block triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
    - Inside the `always` block, check the `reset` signal first to handle synchronous reset.
    - If `reset` is not active, check the `slowena` signal to determine if the counter should increment.
    - Ensure the counter returns to 0 after reaching 9.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input slowena,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Synchronous decade counter logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) 
            q <= 4'b0000;           // Reset counter to 0
        else if (slowena) begin
            if (q == 4'b1001)       // Check if the count reached 9
                q <= 4'b0000;       // Wrap around to 0
            else
                q <= q + 1;         // Increment the counter
        end
        // If slowena is low, retain the current state of q
    end
endmodule
```

This approach ensures the counter correctly counts from 0 to 9, allows for synchronous reset, and pauses when the `slowena` signal is low. The module adheres to typical counter design patterns, supporting modular and efficient implementation in digital systems.
