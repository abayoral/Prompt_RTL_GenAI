Certainly! To create the combinational circuit that implements the given truth table, we'll use the Sum of Products (SOP) method. We'll analyze the rows where the output `f` is 1, which are rows 2, 3, 5, and 7. For each of these rows, we'll write a product term (AND gate expression) and then combine them with an OR gate.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We have a three-input (`x3`, `x2`, `x1`) and one-output (`f`) logic function.
   - Output `f` is `1` for input combinations 010, 011, 101, and 111.
   
2. **Express the Output in SOP Form:**
   - Row 2: `x3=0, x2=1, x1=0` → Product term: `~x3 & x2 & ~x1`
   - Row 3: `x3=0, x2=1, x1=1` → Product term: `~x3 & x2 & x1`
   - Row 5: `x3=1, x2=0, x1=1` → Product term: `x3 & ~x2 & x1`
   - Row 7: `x3=1, x2=1, x1=1` → Product term: `x3 & x2 & x1`
   
3. **Combine Product Terms Using OR:**
   - Use OR to combine the product terms: `(~x3 & x2 & ~x1) | (~x3 & x2 & x1) | (x3 & ~x2 & x1) | (x3 & x2 & x1)`

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Declare the inputs (`x3`, `x2`, `x1`) and output (`f`).
   - Use assign statements to represent the SOP logic.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module(
    input x3,
    input x2,
    input x1,  // three inputs
    output f   // one output
);
    // Implement the SOP logic for the given truth table
    assign f = (~x3 & x2 & ~x1) | 
               (~x3 & x2 & x1) | 
               (x3 & ~x2 & x1) | 
               (x3 & x2 & x1);
               
endmodule
```

This code precisely implements the function described by the truth table using a sum-of-products expression, ensuring correct behavior for each input combination.
