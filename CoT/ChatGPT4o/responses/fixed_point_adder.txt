To design a parameterized fixed-point adder in Verilog, we'll leverage the specified module structure with parameters for fixed-point precision. This implementation will handle both addition and subtraction, depending on the sign bits of the operands, and manage overflow concerns. We'll consider positive and negative numbers, and ensure precision by using the fractional bit parameter.

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understanding Parameters**:
   - `Q` specifies the number of bits dedicated to the fractional part, affecting precision.
   - `N` specifies the total bit-width of the numbers, including integer and fractional parts.

2. **Input and Output Definition**:
   - **Inputs**: Two N-bit fixed-point numbers `a` and `b`.
   - **Output**: An N-bit fixed-point result `c`.

3. **Internal Logic and Calculations**:
   - **Same Sign**: When both numbers have the same sign (MSB), perform a basic addition. Transfer the sign to the result.
   - **Different Sign**: If signs differ, perform subtraction between the numbers based on their absolute values.
   - **Overflow Management**: Track overflows by checking if the resulting sign bit changes unexpectedly.

4. **Precision Handling**:
   - Ensure operations respect the defined fixed-point format by maintaining constant bit-width during arithmetic operations.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use sequential logic to determine the operation based on the signs and execute the addition or subtraction.

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
module fixed_point_adder #(parameter Q = 8, parameter N = 16) (
    input wire [N-1:0] a,
    input wire [N-1:0] b,
    output wire [N-1:0] c
);
    // Internal register to hold the result of addition or subtraction
    reg [N-1:0] res;
    
    // Determine the MSB (sign bit) of each input
    wire sign_a = a[N-1];
    wire sign_b = b[N-1];

    // Calculate the absolute values of 'a' and 'b'
    wire [N-1:0] abs_a = sign_a ? ~a + 1 : a;
    wire [N-1:0] abs_b = sign_b ? ~b + 1 : b;
    
    // Always block for combinational logic
    always @(*) begin
        if (sign_a == sign_b) begin
            // Same sign: Perform addition
            res = abs_a + abs_b;
            // Check for overflow and set the result sign
            res[N-1] = sign_a;  // Copy the sign of the inputs
        end else begin
            // Different sign: Perform subtraction
            if (abs_a >= abs_b) begin
                res = abs_a - abs_b;
                res[N-1] = sign_a;  // The result takes the sign of the larger absolute value
            end else begin
                res = abs_b - abs_a;
                res[N-1] = sign_b;  // The result takes the sign of the larger absolute value
            end
        end
    end

    // Assign the calculated result to the output
    assign c = res;
endmodule
```

This module uses parameterized bit widths to handle fixed-point arithmetic and is capable of determining the appropriate operation based on the inputs' signs. It accurately computes the sum or difference and maintains fixed-point precision by considering the specified number of fractional bits (`Q`). The handling of the MSB ensures that the result consistently represents the expected signed value.
