To implement the state transition logic and output logic for this Moore state machine based on the given state transition table, we will use a combinational approach. The next state and output are determined solely by the current state and input (for the next_state). Let's follow the chain of thought:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We have a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.
   - There is one input (`in`) and one output (`out`).
   - The next state depends on both the current state and the input, while the output depends only on the current state.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `in`, `state`
   - Outputs: `next_state`, `out`

3. **Define State Encoding:**
   - We will use the state encoding specified: `A=2'b00`, `B=2'b01`, `C=2'b10`, `D=2'b11`.

4. **Develop the State Transition and Output Logic:**
   - Use a `case` statement to determine `next_state` and `out` based on the current `state` and `in`.

5. **Implement the Logic in Verilog:**
   - Define the combinational logic within the module using the specified encodings and the transition table.

### Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input in,
    input [1:0] state,
    output reg [1:0] next_state,
    output reg out
);

    parameter A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11;

    // Combinational logic for state transition and output
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            A: begin
                next_state = (in == 0) ? A : B;
                out = 0;
            end
            B: begin
                next_state = (in == 0) ? C : B;
                out = 0;
            end
            C: begin
                next_state = (in == 0) ? A : D;
                out = 0;
            end
            D: begin
                next_state = (in == 0) ? C : B;
                out = 1;
            end
            default: begin
                next_state = A; // default to state A for undefined states
                out = 0; 
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **State Transition Logic:** We use a `case` statement to set `next_state` based on the current `state` and `in`.
- **Output Logic:** The output `out` is determined only by the current state and not the input because this is a Moore machine.
- **Default Case:** Ensures behavior is defined even if the `state` is somehow outside the expected enumeration, defaulting to state A with output 0.
