To implement the circuit described by the given Karnaugh map, let's start by analyzing the K-map:

|          | a'(0) | a(1) |
|----------|-------|------|
| b'c'(00) | 1     | 1    |
| b'c (01) | 1     | 1    |
| bc (11)  | 1     | 1    |
| bc'(10)  | 1     | 1    |

From the K-map, we can see that all combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` result in an output of 1. This means the function is a tautology, i.e., it outputs 1 for all possible input combinations. 

Thus, both the Product-of-Sums (POS) and Sum-of-Products (SOP) forms reduce to the constant value '1'. This is because there are no zeros in the K-map that would require simplification.

**Chain of Thought:**
1. **Understand the Requirements**: The given K-map shows that for every combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output should be 1.
  
2. **K-Map Simplification**:
   - The K-map is completely filled with 1s, which directly implies the output is always 1 regardless of the inputs.
   - The simplified Boolean expression is just `1`.

3. **Implement the Verilog Code**:
   - Simply assign the constant value 1 to the output.

Now, let's write the Verilog code for this:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output out
);
    // The circuit is a tautology, output is always 1
    assign out = 1'b1;
endmodule
```

This code directly implements the fact that the given logic function always produces an output of 1, as derived from the K-map.
