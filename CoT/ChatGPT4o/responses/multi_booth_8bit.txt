Certainly! Let's walk through the steps to create an 8-bit Radix-4 Booth Multiplier using Verilog:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - Implement an 8-bit Booth Multiplier to handle signed multiplication.
   - Inputs: two 8-bit numbers (`a`, `b`), a clock signal (`clk`), and a reset signal (`reset`).
   - Outputs: a 16-bit product (`p`) and a ready signal (`rdy`).

2. **Setup Synchronous Operations:**
   - On the positive edge of `clk`, perform Booth's multiplication steps.
   - If `reset` is high, initialize all internal states to start conditions.

3. **Bit Extension for Signed Operations:**
   - Extend both `a` and `b` to 16 bits to ensure signed multiplication support.
   - Perform initialization and setup based on Booth's algorithm properties.

4. **Algorithm Implementation:**
   - Use a 5-bit counter `ctr` to track up to 16 cycles of operation.
   - Follow Booth's algorithm by adjusting and processing bits, with particular attention to signed aspects.

5. **Initialize and Control Signals:**
   - Clear product and set counter values upon reset.
   - Set `rdy` to indicate the completion.

6. **Code Structure:**
   - Start by declaring the module with specified inputs/outputs.
   - Use always blocks to encapsulate synchronous logic.

### Verilog Code Implementation:

```verilog
module multi_booth_8bit (
    input wire [7:0] a,
    input wire [7:0] b,
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg [15:0] p,
    output reg rdy
);
    // Internal registers
    reg [15:0] multiplicand, product;
    reg [16:0] multiplier;  // Extended to accommodate Booth's processing
    reg [4:0] ctr;          // 5-bit counter for up to 16 cycles

    // Booth's multiplier algorithm on positive edge of clock or reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Initialize values on reset
            multiplicand <= {{8{b[7]}}, b};   // Sign-extended multiplicand
            multiplier <= {{8{a[7]}}, a, 1'b0}; // Sign-extended multiplier with extra bit for Booth
            product <= 16'b0;
            ctr <= 5'b00000;
            rdy <= 1'b0;
        end else if (!rdy) begin
            // Perform Booth's operations
            case (multiplier[1:0])
                2'b01: product <= product + multiplicand; // Add multiplicand
                2'b10: product <= product - multiplicand; // Subtract multiplicand
                default: ; // No operation needed for 2'b00 and 2'b11
            endcase
            
            // Arithmetic shift right multiplier, preserving the sign
            multiplier <= {multiplier[16], multiplier[16:1]};
            // Increment counter
            ctr <= ctr + 1'b1;

            // If 16 operations are complete, finalize
            if (ctr == 5'b10000) begin
                p <= product;  // Assign product to output
                rdy <= 1'b1;   // Set ready signal
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Reset Operation:** On reset, the multiplicand and multiplier are sign-extended, and internal states (product, counter, and ready) are initialized.
- **Booth Operand Processing:** Handles 2-bit Booth encoding (00, 01, 10, 11) to determine arithmetic shifts and computations.
- **Shift and Counter Management:** The multiplier shifts right every cycle, and the counter ensures the loop runs the correct number of times (16 cycles).
- **Output Finalization:** Upon completing 16 cycles, the counter checks, setting the product to output (`p`) and indicating readiness (`rdy`).

This Verilog module follows the Booth multiplication principles, managing its operations over a synchronous reset/process flow, suitable for signed 8-bit multiplications.
