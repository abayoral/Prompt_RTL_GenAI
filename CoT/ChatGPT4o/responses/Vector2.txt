Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need to reverse the byte ordering of a 4-byte word. The input is 32 bits long, and it consists of four 8-bit bytes.
    - The original order is A-B-C-D, where each letter represents a byte. We need to reorder it to D-C-B-A.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Input: `in` (32 bits)
    - Output: `out` (32 bits)
    - Both input and output are 32 bits wide.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are required as the task can be completed with direct assignments.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - We will use part-select to reorder the bytes.
    - The first byte of the output should be the last byte of the input, the second byte of the output should be the third byte of the input, and so on.
    - This can be efficiently handled by specifying bit ranges in the assignment statements.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
    - We will use the part-select feature in Verilog to directly map each byte from the input to the correct position in the output.

Here's the Verilog module implementing the byte order reversal:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [31:0] in,
    output [31:0] out
);

    // Reverse the byte order: D-C-B-A from A-B-C-D
    assign out[31:24] = in[7:0];   // Assign least significant byte of 'in' to most significant byte of 'out'
    assign out[23:16] = in[15:8];  // Second byte of 'in' to second most significant byte of 'out'
    assign out[15:8]  = in[23:16]; // Third byte of 'in' to third byte of 'out'
    assign out[7:0]   = in[31:24]; // Most significant byte of 'in' to least significant byte of 'out'

endmodule
```

This code accurately implements the byte order reversal of the 4-byte word, fulfilling the design specification.
