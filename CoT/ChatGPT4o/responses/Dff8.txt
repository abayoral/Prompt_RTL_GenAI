Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to design a module consisting of 8 individual D flip-flops.
   - Each D flip-flop will capture its respective data input bit `d[i]` on the rising edge of the clock `clk` and store it until the next rising edge.
   - The module should output the stored values as an 8-bit output vector `q`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `d[7:0]` (8-bit data input vector)
   - Outputs: `q[7:0]` (8-bit data output vector that holds the stored values)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed, as each flip-flop can directly output its stored value.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Implement an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, one for each bit of the input.
   - Inside each `always` block, assign the corresponding bit of the input `d` to the output `q`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    // 8 D flip-flops: Capture each bit of d on the rising edge of clk
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- The module `top_module` includes a clock input `clk`, an 8-bit input `d`, and an 8-bit output `q`.
- It uses a single `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of `clk`. 
- On each rising edge of the clock, the input `d` is assigned to the output `q`, effectively capturing the value at the rising edge. Each bit of `d` is stored in the corresponding D flip-flop, and the stored value is available at `q`.
