To implement the heating/cooling thermostat, we need to assign the outputs (heater, aircon, fan) based on the input conditions (too_cold, too_hot, mode, fan_on). We'll utilize the assign statements to express these conditions as logic equations. Let's break down the requirements:

Chain of Thought:

Understand the Requirements:
- The system has two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0).
- In heating mode:
  - Turn the heater on if it's too cold (too_cold = 1) and keep the air conditioner off.
- In cooling mode:
  - Turn the air conditioner on if it's too hot (too_hot = 1) and keep the heater off.
- The fan should be on if either the heater or air conditioner is on, or if the fan is requested to be on (fan_on = 1).

Determine the Logic for Outputs:
- heater should be on when mode = 1 and too_cold = 1.
- aircon should be on when mode = 0 and too_hot = 1.
- fan should be on if the heater or aircon is on, or if fan_on = 1.

Define Intermediate Logic Expressions:
- Compute the conditions for heater, aircon, and fan using straightforward logic and assign statements.

Structuring the Module:
- Start with the module declaration.
- Use assign statements to derive each output based on the logical conditions described.

Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot,
    input mode,
    input fan_on,
    output heater,
    output aircon,
    output fan
);
    // Heater logic: Turn on if mode is heating (1) and it's too cold
    assign heater = mode & too_cold;

    // Air conditioner logic: Turn on if mode is cooling (0) and it's too hot
    assign aircon = ~mode & too_hot;
    
    // Fan logic: Turn on if heater or aircon is on, or if fan_on is requested
    assign fan = heater | aircon | fan_on;

endmodule
```

In this code:
- `heater` is assigned the result of `mode & too_cold` because it should only be activated when the thermostat is in heating mode and it's too cold.
- `aircon` is activated with `~mode & too_hot` as it should only turn on in cooling mode when it's too hot.
- `fan` will turn on when either `heater` or `aircon` is active, or if the `fan_on` input is set high, covering all possible situations mentioned.
