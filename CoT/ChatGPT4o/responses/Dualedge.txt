To create a functionally equivalent dual-edge triggered flip-flop using an FPGA, we can use a combination of positive-edge and negative-edge triggered flip-flops. The idea is to use two separate flip-flops: one triggered on the positive edge and the other on the negative edge. Then, we'll use a multiplexer to select between the outputs of these two flip-flops based on the clock signal. This way, the output `q` will effectively update on both edges of the clock.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to simulate dual-edge triggering behavior using components available in FPGAs.
   - We can use one flip-flop for the positive edge and another for the negative edge.
   - Select between these outputs using a clock-driven multiplexer.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk` for clock, `d` for data input.
   - Output: `q` for the flip-flop output.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - Two intermediate signals will be used to hold the outputs of the positive and negative edge-triggered flip-flops.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Use two flip-flops, one for the positive edge and another for the negative edge of the clock.
   - Output of the flip-flops are the intermediate signals.
   - Use a multiplexer to select between these two signals based on the clock.
   - Logic: If the clock is high, take the output from the positive edge flip-flop; if low, take the output from the negative edge flip-flop.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    // Declare intermediate signals for both edge-triggered flip-flops
    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    // Positive edge-triggered flip-flop
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    // Negative edge-triggered flip-flop
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    // Select between q_pos and q_neg based on the clock
    always @(*) begin
        if (clk) begin
            q = q_pos;
        end else begin
            q = q_neg;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This approach allows you to effectively mimic dual-edge triggered behavior using two flip-flops and a multiplexer, a common technique when dual-edge hardware is unavailable.
