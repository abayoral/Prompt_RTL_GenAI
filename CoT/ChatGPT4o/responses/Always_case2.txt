Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - A 4-bit priority encoder outputs the binary position of the highest priority (leftmost) '1' among the input bits.
   - If the input is `0000`, the output should be `00`.
   - Our task is to generate a 2-bit output (since the binary representation of 0 to 3 requires two bits).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Input**: `in[3:0]` – a 4-bit input.
   - **Output**: `pos[1:0]` – a 2-bit output indicating the position of the highest priority '1'.

3. **Define the Priority Encoding Logic**:
   - Highest priority is assigned to the leftmost bit (`in[3]`), down to the rightmost bit (`in[0]`).
   - The output will be:
     - `pos = 2'd3` if `in[3]` is high.
     - `pos = 2'd2` if `in[3]` is low and `in[2]` is high.
     - `pos = 2'd1` if `in[3]` and `in[2]` are low, but `in[1]` is high.
     - `pos = 2'd0` if only `in[0]` is high (when `in[3]`, `in[2]`, `in[1]` are all low).
     - `pos = 2'd0` if all bits are zero.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Begin with the module declaration and define the inputs and outputs.
   - Use conditional statements to check each bit from highest to lowest priority and assign the correct output value to `pos`.
   - Given the simple conditional requirements, a sequential chain of if-else statements is suitable.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [3:0] in,
    output reg [1:0] pos
);

    // Priority encoding logic
    always @(*) begin
        if (in[3])
            pos = 2'd3;
        else if (in[2])
            pos = 2'd2;
        else if (in[1])
            pos = 2'd1;
        else if (in[0])
            pos = 2'd0;
        else
            pos = 2'd0;
    end

endmodule
```

In this solution:
- The `always` block implements combinational logic, checking the bits from the highest priority (`in[3]`) to the lowest (`in[0]`).
- This ensures `pos` contains the binary position of the highest '1', handling the zero-input case as specified.
