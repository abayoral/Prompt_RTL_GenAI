To solve this problem, let's break down the requirements using the provided hint to think "backwards" from outputs:

Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
   - The output `motor` should be activated when the phone is in vibrate mode (`vibrate_mode = 1`), regardless of the `ring` input.
   - The output `ringer` should be activated when the phone is not in vibrate mode (`vibrate_mode = 0`) and the `ring` input is active.
   - The constraints specify that either `ringer` or `motor` can be high at any time, but not both simultaneously.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
   - Inputs: `ring`, `vibrate_mode`
   - Outputs: `ringer`, `motor`

3. Define the Logic for Output Signals:
   - `motor`: The `motor` should be activated when `vibrate_mode` is high.
   - `ringer`: The `ringer` should be activated when `vibrate_mode` is low and `ring` is high.

4. Structuring the Module:
   - Using assign statements to define the behavior of `ringer` and `motor`.
   - Implement the logic such that `ringer` and `motor` outputs are mutually exclusive.

5. Writing the Verilog Code:

Here's the Verilog module implementing this logic:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire ring,
    input wire vibrate_mode,
    output wire ringer,  // Make sound
    output wire motor    // Vibrate
);

    // The motor is on when vibrate_mode is high
    assign motor = vibrate_mode;

    // The ringer is on when vibrate_mode is low and ring is high
    assign ringer = ~vibrate_mode & ring;

endmodule
```

In this implementation:
- The `motor` is turned on whenever `vibrate_mode` is high, as specified.
- The `ringer` is turned on only if `vibrate_mode` is low and `ring` is high. This ensures that the outputs `ringer` and `motor` are mutually exclusive, preserving the requirement that both cannot be active simultaneously.
