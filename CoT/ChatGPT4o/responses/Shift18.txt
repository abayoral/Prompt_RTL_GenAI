To develop the 64-bit arithmetic shift register with synchronous load, we need to implement the logic that adheres to the given requirements. Let's break down the requirements using a chain of thought approach to develop the Verilog code:

### Chain of Thought

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - The module needs to either load a new 64-bit data input synchronously or shift the current data based on control signals.
   - It performs both logical left shifts and arithmetic right shifts.
   - The shift operations can be performed by 1 bit or by 8 bits depending on the `amount` input.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Inputs: `clk` (clock), `load` (synchronous load), `ena` (enable shifting), `amount` (shift direction and distance), `data` (input to load).
   - Output: `q` (contents of the shift register).

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
   - We don't require any intermediate signals as the operation can be decided directly in combinational logic.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Start with the module declaration specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an `always` block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to implement the sequential logic.
   - Inside the `always` block, check the `load` signal first. If `load` is high, update `q` with the input `data`.
   - If not loading, and `ena` is high, perform the shift based on the value of `amount`:
     - `amount = 2'b00`: Shift `q` left by 1 bit.
     - `amount = 2'b01`: Shift `q` left by 8 bits.
     - `amount = 2'b10`: Shift `q` right by 1 bit (arithmetic shift, preserve the sign bit).
     - `amount = 2'b11`: Shift `q` right by 8 bits (arithmetic shift, preserve the sign bit).

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input ena,
    input [1:0] amount,
    input [63:0] data,
    output reg [63:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the data into the shift register
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            // Perform shifting based on the amount
            case (amount)
                2'b00: q <= q << 1; // Shift left by 1 bit
                2'b01: q <= q << 8; // Shift left by 8 bits
                2'b10: q <= {q[63], q[63:1]}; // Arithmetic shift right by 1 bit
                2'b11: q <= { {8{q[63]}}, q[63:8] }; // Arithmetic shift right by 8 bits
                default: q <= q; // Default case, shouldn't be needed
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Synchronous Load**: Ensures that if `load` is true, `data` is loaded into `q`.
- **Enable Shift**: Shifting is only performed if `ena` is true.
- **Amount Logic**: A `case` statement is used to handle all the shift operations based on the `amount` input, where:
  - Left shifts replace rightmost bits with zero.
  - Right shifts preserve the sign bit (arithmetic shift) for both by 1 and by 8 positions.

This module will achieve the desired functionality of a 64-bit arithmetic shift register with a synchronous load feature, operating efficiently based on the control inputs.
