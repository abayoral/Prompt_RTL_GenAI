To implement the module with 16 D flip-flops that have byte-enable inputs, we must carefully consider the control signals to manage which parts of the data (upper byte or lower byte) are written to the registers on each clock cycle. The `resetn` signal is a synchronous active-low reset, meaning that on the next clock edge, if resetn is low, the outputs should be reset. Here is the Chain of Thought to solve the task:

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need 16 D flip-flops to store a 16-bit wide data input `d`.
   - The flip-flops' outputs are represented by `q`.
   - The `byteena` control signal should determine which bytes of `q` get updated with `d` on each clock cycle.
     - `byteena[0]`: Controls the lower byte `d[7:0]`.
     - `byteena[1]`: Controls the upper byte `d[15:8]`.
   - A synchronous active-low reset (`resetn`) should set `q` to zero when it's low.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk`, `resetn`, `byteena`, `d`
   - Output: `q`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are necessary as this can be managed directly in the always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Declare the module with specified inputs and outputs.
   - Provide a register array for the output `q` to store data.
   - Use an always block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
   - Implement the synchronous reset and byte-enable logic:
     - If `resetn` is low, reset the output `q` to zero.
     - Otherwise, if byteena[0] is high, update q[7:0] with d[7:0].
     - If byteena[1] is high, update q[15:8] with d[15:8].

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input resetn,
    input [1:0] byteena,
    input [15:0] d,
    output reg [15:0] q
);

    // Flip-flop logic: Capture d based on byteena and resetn signals
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (!resetn) begin
            q <= 16'b0; // Asynchronous active-low reset
        end else begin
            if (byteena[0]) begin
                q[7:0] <= d[7:0]; // Update lower byte if byteena[0] is high
            end
            if (byteena[1]) begin
                q[15:8] <= d[15:8]; // Update upper byte if byteena[1] is high
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This module implements 16 D flip-flops with byte-enable control and an active-low synchronous reset.
