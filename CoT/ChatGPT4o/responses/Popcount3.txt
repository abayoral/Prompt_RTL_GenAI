Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - A population count circuit calculates the number of '1's in a binary input vector.
   - For a 3-bit input vector, the output should represent how many of the input bits are '1'.
   - The possible range for a 3-bit vector (3 bits) is from 0 to 3, thus a 2-bit output is sufficient to represent this count.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Input: `in[2:0]` (3-bit input vector)
   - Output: `out[1:0]` (2-bit output representing the count of '1's)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
   - No intermediate signals are needed, as the logic can be implemented directly using conditional expressions.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
   - Declare the module, specifying inputs and outputs.
   - Use bitwise operations and conditional logic to compute the number of '1's in the input vector.
   - Assign the computed count to the output `out`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code**:
   - Use a combination of bitwise AND and addition operations to count the '1's.

The final Verilog code is as follows:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [2:0] in,
    output [1:0] out
);
    // Population count logic: Count the number of '1's in the 3-bit input vector
    assign out = in[0] + in[1] + in[2];
endmodule
```

**Explanation**:
- The module counts the number of `1`s in the `in[2:0]` vector by directly adding the bits `in[0]`, `in[1]`, and `in[2]`.
- This sum provides the number of `1`s in the 3-bit input vector and assigns the result to the 2-bit output `out`.
