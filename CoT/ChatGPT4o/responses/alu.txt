To create a comprehensive Verilog module named "alu" that meets the outlined requirements, we will implement a 32-bit ALU capable of performing various MIPS ISA CPU operations. This implementation will use the input opcode 'aluc' to determine which operation to perform, including arithmetic, logical, and shift operations, as well as handling special instructions like LUI. Here is the Verilog code:

```verilog
module alu (
    input wire [31:0] a,
    input wire [31:0] b,
    input wire [5:0] aluc,
    output reg [31:0] r,
    output reg zero,
    output reg carry,
    output reg negative,
    output reg overflow,
    output reg flag
);
    // Intermediate variables to detect overflow for signed operations
    wire signed [31:0] signed_a;
    wire signed [31:0] signed_b;
    wire signed [31:0] signed_r;
    assign signed_a = a;
    assign signed_b = b;
    
    always @* begin
        // Default values
        r = 32'bz;
        zero = 0;
        carry = 0;
        negative = 0;
        overflow = 0;
        flag = 0;
        
        case (aluc)
            6'b100000: begin // ADD: signed addition
                {carry, r} = a + b;
                overflow = (signed_a[31] == signed_b[31]) && (r[31] != signed_a[31]);
            end
            6'b100001: begin // ADDU: unsigned addition
                {carry, r} = a + b;
                overflow = 0; // No overflow in unsigned addition
            end
            6'b100010: begin // SUB: signed subtraction
                {carry, r} = a - b;
                overflow = (signed_a[31] != signed_b[31]) && (r[31] != signed_a[31]);
            end
            6'b100011: begin // SUBU: unsigned subtraction
                {carry, r} = a - b;
                overflow = 0; // No overflow in unsigned subtraction
            end
            6'b100100: r = a & b; // AND
            6'b100101: r = a | b; // OR
            6'b100110: r = a ^ b; // XOR
            6'b100111: r = ~(a | b); // NOR
            6'b101010: begin // SLT: set on less than (signed)
                flag = (signed_a < signed_b);
                r = {31'b0, flag};
            end
            6'b101011: begin // SLTU: set on less than unsigned
                flag = (a < b);
                r = {31'b0, flag};
            end
            6'b000000: r = b << a[4:0]; // SLL: logical shift left
            6'b000010: r = b >> a[4:0]; // SRL: logical shift right
            6'b000011: r = $signed(b) >>> a[4:0]; // SRA: arithmetic shift right
            6'b000100: r = b << a[4:0]; // SLLV: variable logical shift left
            6'b000110: r = b >> a[4:0]; // SRLV: variable logical shift right
            6'b000111: r = $signed(b) >>> a[4:0]; // SRAV: variable arithmetic shift right
            6'b001111: r = {b[15:0], 16'b0}; // LUI: load upper immediate
            default: r = 32'bz; // Unhandled cases, high-impedance state
        endcase
        
        // Zero, Negative and Sign detection
        zero = (r == 32'b0);
        negative = r[31];
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `a`, `b`: 32-bit operands.
  - `aluc`: 6-bit opcode determining the ALU operation.
  - `r`: 32-bit result of the operation.
  - `zero`: Output flag set to 1 if the result is zero.
  - `carry`: Set if there's a carry from the most significant bit during addition or subtraction.
  - `negative`: Set if the most significant bit of the result (indicating a negative number) is 1.
  - `overflow`: Set if an arithmetic overflow occurs during signed arithmetic operations.
  - `flag`: Used specifically for SLT/SLTU operations.

- **Operations and Logic**:
  - We use a `case` statement to select operations based on the `aluc` opcode.
  - Arithmetic operations (ADD, ADDU, SUB, SUBU) handle both signed and unsigned calculations.
  - Logical operations include AND, OR, XOR, and NOR.
  - Set on less than uses signed and unsigned comparisons to compute `flag`.
  - Shift operations are conducted using `<<`, `>>`, and `>>>` for logic and arithmetic shifts.
  - The LUI instruction involves shifting and zero-filling the least significant 16 bits.
  - For any cases not covered, the result defaults to a high impedance `32'bz`.
