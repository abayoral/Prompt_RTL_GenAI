To complete the task of creating 8 D flip-flops with an active high synchronous reset, we need to consider the following:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We are tasked to create a module with 8 D flip-flops.
   - Each flip-flop captures the value of the corresponding bit in the input `d` at the negative edge of the clock (`clk`).
   - The reset is synchronous and active high, meaning it takes effect only on the clock edge.
   - When reset is activated, the output `q` should be set to `0x34` instead of zero.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk`, `reset`, `d[7:0]`
   - Outputs: `q[7:0]`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No additional signals are required beyond the input/output declarations for this straightforward D flip-flop array.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Begin with the module declaration specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an `always` block that triggers on the negative edge of the clock to capture `d` or the specified reset state.
   - Implement synchronous reset within the always block to set `q` to `0x34` when `reset` is high.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    // D flip-flops with synchronous reset logic
    // Trigger on the negative edge of the clock
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 8'h34; // Set q to 0x34 when reset is high
        end
        else begin
            q <= d; // Capture the input d otherwise
        end
    end
endmodule
```

This code fulfills the requirement by using an `always` block that triggers on the negative edge of the clock. The synchronous reset logic ensures that `q` is set to `0x34` when `reset` is high during a clock phase.
