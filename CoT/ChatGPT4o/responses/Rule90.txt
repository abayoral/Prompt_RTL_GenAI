To implement Rule 90 cellular automaton with 512 cells, we need to carefully define the logic as explained in the task. Let's walk through the process of creating this module:

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We have a 512-cell array (`q[511:0]`).
   - Rule 90 specifies the future state of a cell as the XOR of its neighbors.
   - We need to implement a shift operation based on XOR for each cell using its neighboring cells.
   - The initial state can be loaded using the `load` signal and the `data` input.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `load` (control signal), `data[511:0]` (input data for initializing).
   - Output: `q[511:0]` (state of the cellular system).

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed, but a temporary register will store the next state.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Declare the module with its inputs and outputs.
   - Use a register to hold the state `q` because we need to update it on each clock cycle.
   - Utilize an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
   - Inside the always block, first check if `load` is high to initialize `q` with `data`.
   - If `load` is not active, update each cell according to Rule 90 using XOR operations.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

Here's the Verilog module based on the explanation:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    integer i;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            for (i = 0; i < 512; i = i + 1) begin
                if (i == 0)
                    q[i] <=  q[i+1]; // For the leftmost cell, treat q[-1] as 0
                else if (i == 511)
                    q[i] <= q[i-1]; // For the rightmost cell, treat q[512] as 0
                else
                    q[i] <= q[i-1] ^ q[i+1]; // For all other cells, use Rule 90
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- The module uses an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- When `load` is high, the `q` array is initialized to the `data` input.
- When `load` is low, Rule 90 logic is applied to update `q`. Cells at the boundaries handle the imaginary zero-padding by only considering in-range neighbors.
