Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A half adder is a combinational circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers (a, b).
        It produces two outputs: sum and carry-out (cout).
        The sum is the XOR of the input bits a and b.
        The carry-out is the AND of the input bits a and b.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a, b
        Outputs: sum, cout

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed, as the logic is straightforward and can be implemented directly in assign statements.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use assign statements to define the outputs (sum and cout).
        The sum output is calculated using the XOR operator on the input bits.
        The cout output (carry-out) is calculated using the AND operator on the input bits.

    Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b,
    output cout, 
    output sum 
);
    // Half adder logic: sum is the XOR of a and b, cout is the AND of a and b
    assign sum = a ^ b;
    assign cout = a & b;
endmodule
```

This code represents a simple half adder in Verilog, which efficiently adds two single-bit inputs and outputs the sum and carry-out.
