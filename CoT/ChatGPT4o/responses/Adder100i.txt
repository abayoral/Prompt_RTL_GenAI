To develop a 100-bit binary ripple-carry adder by instantiating 100 full adders, we need to follow a systematic approach. Each full adder will compute the sum of the bits from the input numbers along with the carry-in, and produce a sum bit and a carry-out bit. The carry-out from one full adder becomes the carry-in for the next full adder.

Here's the chain of thought and resulting Verilog code:

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to add two 100-bit numbers (`a` and `b`) and a carry-in (`cin`) to produce a 100-bit sum (`sum`) and a series of carry-outs (`cout`).
   - Each full adder calculates one bit of the sum and a carry-out.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a[99:0]`, `b[99:0]`, `cin`
   - Outputs: `sum[99:0]`, `cout[99:0]`

3. **Full Adder Design:**
   - A full adder takes three inputs: two bits (`x`, `y`) and a carry-in (`cin`), and produces two outputs: a sum bit (`s`) and a carry-out (`cout`).
   - The logical equations for a full adder are:
     - Sum: `s = x ^ y ^ cin`
     - Carry-Out: `cout = (x & y) | (y & cin) | (x & cin)`

4. **Ripple-Carry Adder Construction:**
   - We will instantiate an array of 100 full adders.
   - Use a generate block to instantiate the full adders iteratively.
   - The first adder takes `cin` as input for `carry_in`, and its carry-out connects to the next adder's carry-in, forming a chain.

5. **Generate Statement:**
   - We'll use a `genvar` loop to instantiate 100 full adders, ensuring each adder's outputs connect to the next one's inputs properly.

6. **Writing the Verilog Code:**
   - Implement a full adder as a module.
   - Use a generate block to instantiate 100 full adders within the top module.

```verilog
module full_adder (
    input x,
    input y,
    input cin,
    output sum,
    output cout
);
    // Full adder logic
    assign sum = x ^ y ^ cin;
    assign cout = (x & y) | (y & cin) | (x & cin);
endmodule

module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a,
    input [99:0] b,
    input cin,
    output [99:0] cout,
    output [99:0] sum 
);
    // Internal carry signal
    wire [99:0] carry;
    
    // Generate statement to instantiate 100 full adders
    genvar i;
    generate
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin: fa
            if (i == 0) begin
                // First full adder uses the initial carry-in
                full_adder u_full_adder (
                    .x(a[i]),
                    .y(b[i]),
                    .cin(cin),
                    .sum(sum[i]),
                    .cout(carry[i])
                );
            end else begin
                // Subsequent full adders use carry from previous adder
                full_adder u_full_adder (
                    .x(a[i]),
                    .y(b[i]),
                    .cin(carry[i-1]),
                    .sum(sum[i]),
                    .cout(carry[i])
                );
            end
        end
    endgenerate

    // Assign the carry outputs
    assign cout = carry;
endmodule
```

This Verilog code successfully implements a 100-bit ripple-carry adder using a full adder module, ensuring that each stage's carry-out is correctly passed to the next, culminating in the final carry-out output `cout[99]`.
