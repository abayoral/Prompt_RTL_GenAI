To implement the Read-Only Memory (ROM) module as described, let's follow the specified requirements and structure our thought process accordingly.

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - The ROM module has an 8-bit address input that selects one of the 256 memory locations.
   - Each memory location stores a 16-bit data value.
   - The output is the data stored at the address specified by the input.
   - Initialize some of the memory locations as specified in the initial block.
   - The ROM supports only read operations; data cannot be modified during operation.

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Input: `addr [7:0]` - 8-bit address.
   - Output: `dout [15:0]` - 16-bit data output.

3. **Define the Memory Array**:
   - Use a memory array `reg [15:0] mem [0:255]` to store the 256 16-bit data values.

4. **Initialize the Memory Array**:
   - In the `initial` block, set specific initial values for memory addresses 0 through 3.

5. **Design the Output Logic**:
   - Use an `always @(*)` block to ensure that the `dout` output gets updated whenever there is any change in the memory content or the address input.

6. **Structure the Verilog Module**:
   - Begin with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Implement the memory array and initialization in an `initial` block.
   - Include logic to fetch the value from the memory at the specified address and assign it to `dout`.

### Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module ROM (
    input wire [7:0] addr,
    output reg [15:0] dout
);

    // Declare the ROM memory array with 256 16-bit locations
    reg [15:0] mem [0:255];

    // Initialize some memory locations with specific values
    initial begin
        mem[0] = 16'hA0A0;
        mem[1] = 16'hB1B1;
        mem[2] = 16'hC2C2;
        mem[3] = 16'hD3D3;
        // Additional initial values can be set as needed
    end

    // Output logic: Update dout based on the address input
    always @(*) begin
        dout = mem[addr];
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Memory Declaration**: The `reg [15:0] mem [0:255];` line creates an array where each entry can hold a 16-bit value, with 256 entries total, corresponding to the possible addresses from 8-bit input `addr`.
- **Initialization**: The `initial` block is used to set initial values for specific addresses. While the example initializes addresses 0 to 3, other addresses can be initialized based on additional requirements or left unspecified.
- **Read Logic**: The `always @(*)` block ensures `dout` is updated dynamically to match the data stored at the address specified by `addr`. This block automatically triggers when any dependency (`addr`) changes, ensuring correct read-only behavior as specified.
