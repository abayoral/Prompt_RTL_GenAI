To design the `width_8to16` module, we need to focus on properly handling the 8-bit to 16-bit data conversion, ensuring data is processed in sync with the clock and reset, and communicating the validity of the output.

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We are converting two sequential 8-bit inputs into one 16-bit output.
   - The first input should be stored in the higher 8 bits of the 16-bit output and the second input in the lower 8 bits.
   - The `valid_out` signal should only be high when the 16-bit output is valid and ready, which occurs after receiving two valid 8-bit inputs.

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Inputs:**
     - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronization.
     - `rst_n`: Active-low reset to initialize or reset the module.
     - `valid_in`: Indicates if the current 8-bit input data is valid.
     - `data_in`: The 8-bit data input.
   - **Outputs:**
     - `valid_out`: Indicates when the output data is valid.
     - `data_out`: The 16-bit data output composed of two concatenated 8-bit inputs.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - A register to store the first 8-bit part temporarily.
   - A flag to track whether we have stored the first 8-bit data.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Use an always block synchronized with the clock and responsive to the reset signal.
   - Implement a mechanism to store the first valid 8-bit input.
   - Concatenate the stored value with the second valid input and set the `valid_out` accordingly.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module width_8to16 (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire valid_in,
    input wire [7:0] data_in,
    output reg valid_out,
    output reg [15:0] data_out
);
    // Internal signals
    reg [7:0] stored_data;
    reg has_first_data; // Flag to indicate first data has been stored

    // Always block to process inputs and produce the output
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            // Reset logic
            data_out <= 16'b0;
            valid_out <= 1'b0;
            stored_data <= 8'b0;
            has_first_data <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            if (valid_in) begin
                if (!has_first_data) begin
                    // Store the first 8-bit input
                    stored_data <= data_in;
                    has_first_data <= 1'b1;
                end else begin
                    // Concatenate the stored data with the new input and output it
                    data_out <= {stored_data, data_in};
                    valid_out <= 1'b1;
                    has_first_data <= 1'b0; // Reset the flag after handling
                end
            end
            // Reset valid_out if no new complete data
            if (has_first_data == 1'b0) begin
                valid_out <= 1'b0;
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Reset Logic:** The module is reset to zero output and valid signals are cleared when `rst_n` is low.
- **Data Handling:** On the clock's rising edge, if `valid_in` is high:
  - If the first 8-bit data isn't stored yet, store `data_in` in `stored_data` and set a flag (`has_first_data`).
  - If the first 8-bit data is already stored (indicating this is the second valid input), concatenate `stored_data` and `data_in` to form the 16-bit `data_out`, and set `valid_out` to high, signaling the 16-bit output is ready.
- **Sequential processing ensures** that the correct order of operations is maintained, and `valid_out` accurately reflects the completion of the conversion.
