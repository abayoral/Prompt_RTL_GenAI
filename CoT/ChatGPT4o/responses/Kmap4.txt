To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given Karnaugh map to simplify the logic equation. The Karnaugh map is structured with the variables a, b, c, and d and is filled with the corresponding output values. Here's how the simplification process can be approached:

### Analyze and Simplify the Karnaugh Map

The K-map provided is:
```
|       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|
| c'd'  | 0    | 1    | 0   | 1   |
| c'd   | 1    | 0    | 1   | 0   |
| cd    | 0    | 1    | 0   | 1   |
| cd'   | 1    | 0    | 1   | 0   |
```

### Step 1: Identify Groups for Sum-of-Products

- Horizontal Group (c'd') across a'b and ab': Represented as: \( b \cdot c' \cdot d' \) 
- Horizontal Group (c'd) across a'b' and ab: Represented as: \( a' \cdot d \) 
- Horizontal Group (cd) across a'b and ab': Represented as: \( b \cdot c \)
- Horizontal Group (cd') across a'b' and ab: Represented as: \( a' \cdot c' \)

### Sum-of-Products (SOP) Form:
The SOP form is obtained by summing all the products (ON cells):
\[ \text{Output (out)} = (b \cdot c' \cdot d') + (a' \cdot d) + (b \cdot c) + (a' \cdot c') \]

### Step 2: Implement the Simplified Logic in Verilog

Based on the simplification, we translate the solution into Verilog code.

```verilog
module top_module(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire out
);

    // Sum-of-Products expression for the given K-map
    assign out = (b & ~c & ~d) | (~a & d) | (b & c) | (~a & ~c);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The Verilog code uses logical operators AND (&), OR (|), and NOT (~) to implement the simplified logic expression.
- The output `out` is determined by the values of the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on the SOP expression derived from the Karnaugh map.

This implementation directly follows the reduced logic form that we derived and accurately represents the behavior specified in the given Karnaugh map.
