Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to detect a positive edge for each bit in an 8-bit vector `in`.
    - A positive edge is defined as a transition from 0 to 1.
    - The output vector `pedge` should set the relevant bit the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `clk`, `in` (8-bit vector)
    - Outputs: `pedge` (8-bit vector)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - We need to store the previous state of the input vector `in` to check for transitions.
    - Use an 8-bit register `prev_in` to store the previous state of `in`.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to capture state transitions.
    - Inside the always block, compare the current state and the previous state:
        - For each bit in the vector, if the previous state was 0 and the current state is 1, set the corresponding bit in `pedge`.
    - After processing the edge detection, update `prev_in` with the current `in` to prepare for the next cycle.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

    // Register to store the previous state of 'in'
    reg [7:0] prev_in;

    // Always block to detect positive edges
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Detect positive edges on each bit and update 'pedge'
        pedge <= (~prev_in) & in;
        
        // Update 'prev_in' with the current state of 'in'
        prev_in <= in;
    end

endmodule
```

This module will output a high signal on the `pedge` vector for each bit where a 0 to 1 transition is detected in the `in` vector, thereby providing a synchronous "positive edge detection" functionality.
