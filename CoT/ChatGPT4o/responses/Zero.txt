Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The requirement is to build a Verilog module with no inputs and a single output.
        The output should always be a constant logic level of 0.
        This means the output wire should be permanently tied to logic 0.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: None
        Output: zero

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed as we are directly assigning a constant value to the output.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the output only as there are no inputs.
        Use an assign statement to tie the output wire to logic 0.
        This will ensure that the output is always 0, regardless of any other signals or time.

    Writing the Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module(
    output wire zero
);
    // Assign a constant value of 0 to the output
    assign zero = 1'b0;
endmodule
```

This module will consistently produce an output of 0, fulfilling the specified requirement.
