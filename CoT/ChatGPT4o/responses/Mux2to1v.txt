To implement a 100-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer, we will utilize the ternary operator for concise logic. This multiplexer will select between two 100-bit inputs based on the value of the select signal (`sel`). Here's the step-by-step thought process and the resulting Verilog implementation:

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to create a 2-to-1 multiplexer that operates on 100-bit wide input signals.
   - The multiplexer selects one of the two inputs (a or b) based on the value of a 1-bit control signal `sel`.
   - If `sel` is 0, the output should be the value of `a`.
   - If `sel` is 1, the output should be the value of `b`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a[99:0]`, `b[99:0]`, `sel`
   - Output: `out[99:0]`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are required, as the logic can be expressed directly in a single assign statement using the ternary operator.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an assign statement to define the multiplexer logic, employing the ternary operator to conditionally select between `a` and `b` based on `sel`.

5. **Writing the Verilog Code:**  
   Here is the complete Verilog code for the desired 100-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer.

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] a, 
    input [99:0] b,
    input sel,
    output [99:0] out
);

    // Multiplexer logic: Select b if sel is high, otherwise select a
    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;

endmodule
```

By using the ternary operator in this manner, we maintain clarity and readability, ensuring that the design meets functionality and maintainability requirements.
