To implement the circuit described by the given Karnaugh Map, we first need to simplify it. Analyzing the K-map allows us to derive the minimized boolean expression using either Sum of Products (SOP) or Product of Sums (POS).

### Karnaugh Map Analysis:

|       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|
| c'd'  | d    | 0    | 1   | 1   |
| c'd   | 0    | 0    | d   | d   |
| cd    | 0    | 1    | 1   | 1   |
| cd'   | 0    | 1    | 1   | 1   |

Here are the minterms (in decimal form) that produce an output of `1`:
- Minterms: **5**, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14

The don't-care conditions are:
- Don't-Cares: **0**, 10, 12

**Simplification using Sum of Products (SOP):**

Include the don't-cares to simplify the logic:
- The final simplification can be obtained by grouping as follows:
  1. Group the entire row with c = 1 (cd) and cd'.
  2. Group of minterm 5 when d = 1.

This leads to the simplified expression:
- **SOP:** \( a'd + ac + b'c \)

**Verilog Code Implementation:**

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out
);

    // Simplified SOP expression: a'd + ac + b'c
    assign out = (~a & d) | (a & c) | (~b & c);

endmodule
```

This Verilog module captures the simplified logic from the analysis, implementing the circuit according to the Karnaugh Map reduction. The approach ensures that the critical module behaves as desired for the given conditions, including the use of don't-care terms to simplify the hardware logic design.
