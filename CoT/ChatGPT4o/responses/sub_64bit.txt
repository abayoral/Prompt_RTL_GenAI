To design a 64-bit subtractor module in Verilog that detects overflow conditions, we'll follow these steps in our chain of thought:

### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - Perform a subtraction operation between two 64-bit signed integers: `A - B`.
    - Provide a 64-bit output `result` representing the subtraction's result.
    - Set an `overflow` signal to 1 when an overflow condition is detected, and 0 otherwise.

2. **Overflow Detection**:
    - Overflow in signed subtraction occurs under two conditions:
        1. A positive `A` minus a negative `B` results in a negative `result` (positive overflow).
        2. A negative `A` minus a positive `B` results in a positive `result` (negative overflow).

3. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `A[63:0]`, `B[63:0]`
    - Outputs: `result[63:0]`, `overflow`

4. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - The computation includes the subtraction itself and checking the signs of `A`, `B`, and `result`.

5. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Perform subtraction operation to produce `result`.
    - Use bitwise operations to check for overflow conditions:
        - Use the sign bit (MSB) for overflow detection.
        - Implement logic to check if there's an overflow.

6. **Write the Verilog Code**:
    - Implement the module according to the requirements.

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
module sub_64bit (
    input wire [63:0] A,
    input wire [63:0] B,
    output wire [63:0] result,
    output wire overflow
);
    // Perform subtraction
    assign result = A - B;

    // Detect overflow
    // Positive overflow: (A[63] == 0) and (B[63] == 1) and (result[63] == 1)
    // Negative overflow: (A[63] == 1) and (B[63] == 0) and (result[63] == 0)
    assign overflow = ((~A[63] & B[63] & result[63]) |
                       (A[63] & ~B[63] & ~result[63]));

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- The `result` is computed by directly subtracting `B` from `A`, taking advantage of Verilog's handling of signed arithmetic when the sign bits are appropriately interpreted.
- The `overflow` signal is determined by checking the conditions for overflow using the sign bits:
  - A positive overflow is detected if `A` is positive, `B` is negative, and `result` is negative.
  - A negative overflow is detected if `A` is negative, `B` is positive, and `result` is positive.
- By bitwise checking these conditions, the `overflow` signal is correctly set according to the subtraction result. 

This module captures the required logic for performing a 64-bit subtraction with overflow detection.
