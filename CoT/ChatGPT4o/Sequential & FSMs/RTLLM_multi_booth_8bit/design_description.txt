You are trained on data up to October 2023. Could you please fulfill the role of a professional Verilog designer tasked with creating a digital design? Specifically, the goal is to implement an 8-bit Radix-4 Booth Multiplier. This design involves multiplying two 8-bit binary numbers, labeled as inputs 'a' and 'b', by employing the Booth algorithm, an algorithm widely used for multiplication in digital systems due to its efficiency in handling signed numbers and reducing the number of required additive operations.

The implementation should also include:
- A clock signal, denoted as 'clk', which is pivotal for coordinating the synchronous operations of your design.
- A reset signal, labeled 'reset', that serves to initialize the multiplier module to a known starting state whenever needed. This can ensure correctness upon startup or during specific conditions when a reset is necessary.

Your design will provide two outputs:
1. 'p': A 16-bit wide output that holds the resulting product of the multiplication process. Given the nature of Booth's multiplication and the input sizes, the resulting product must be able to represent signed numbers effectively, thus requiring 16 bits.
2. 'rdy': A 'ready' signal indicating the end of the multiplication operation. When 'rdy' is set to 1, this signals that the product 'p' is available and the operation is complete.

The module should follow these further specifications:
- Name the module `multi_booth_8bit`.
- Utilize the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk' and the positive edge of the reset signal 'reset' to govern the module's operations.
- On detecting a high reset signal, extend both inputs 'a' and 'b' to 16 bits by replicating their most significant bit (indicating sign) to fill the upper 8 bits; multiplier <= {{8{a[7]}}, a} and multiplicand <= {{8{b[7]}}, b}. This step is crucial for maintaining signed arithmetic operations, as Booth's algorithm relies on the 2’s complement representation.
- Use a 5-bit counter 'ctr' to track the progression of the algorithm and ensure its operations don’t exceed 16 cycles.
- Within each cycle, when reset is low, shift the multiplicand left by one position, which simulates the effect of the Booth algorithm's requirement of bit alignment adjustments.
- Accumulate the multiplicand into the product 'p' when the Booth encoding in the current cycle, indicated by multiplier bits, dictates an addition.
- Increment the counter after each cycle, and once it reaches a count of 16, finalize the process by setting the 'rdy' signal to 1, communicating the multiplication completion.

Could you provide the comprehensive Verilog code that achieves this multiplication process as defined?
