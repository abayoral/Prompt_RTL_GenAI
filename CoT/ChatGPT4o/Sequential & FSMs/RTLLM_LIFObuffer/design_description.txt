As an experienced Verilog designer, imagine designing a module for a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer specifically intended for temporary data storage operations. The design should focus on a LIFO buffer that has a width of 4 bits per data entry and can accommodate up to four such entries, allowing for efficient data manipulation through the established operations of push and pop. The operations are controlled by read/write (RW) signals to ensure correct data flow.

**Module Name**:  
- The module should be addressed as `LIFObuffer`.

**Input Ports**:
- `dataIn [3:0]`: A 4-bit input bus that accepts data to be pushed onto the top of the buffer, essentially serving as the write data input.
- `RW`: This serves as the Read/Write control signal, where a value of '1' signifies a read operation from the buffer, and a value of '0' indicates a write operation, or push, to the buffer.
- `EN`: An Enable signal that activates buffer operations when asserted, ensuring that actions occur only under the designated conditions.
- `Rst`: An active-high Reset signal, used to initialize or reinitialize the buffer, which ensures that all entries in the buffer are cleared and the system is set to its default state.
- `Clk`: A Clock signal utilized for synchronous operations, ensuring that all actions within the buffer happen in alignment with the clock cycles.

**Output Ports**:
- `EMPTY`: An indicator flag that shows whether the buffer is currently devoid of any stored data.
- `FULL`: An indicator flag that reflects whether the buffer has reached its maximum storage capacity.
- `dataOut [3:0]`: A 4-bit output bus that retrieves data popped from the buffer, serving as the read data output.

**Implementation Overview**:
- The buffer's fundamental storage component is a stack memory array, often referred to as `stack_mem`, where each slot can store a 4-bit data entry. Its function is to store and retrieve data following LIFO principles.
- The stack utilizes a stack pointer (`SP`) to keep track of the current position within the stack, facilitating both push and pop operations. 
- On each rising edge of the clock signal (`Clk`), provided that the enable signal (`EN`) is high, the buffer checks the conditions dictated by the reset and read/write signals to determine the operation sequence:
  - If the reset signal (`Rst`) is active (high), the stack memory and the stack pointer are reset to their initial states — the stack pointer is moved to a position indicating an empty stack (e.g., 4 in this case), and all data entries within the stack memory are cleared to zeros.
  - If the reset signal is inactive (low), the buffer inspects its current status — whether it is full or empty:
    - If a push action (RW is low) is instructed and the stack is not full, the buffer will push data from `dataIn` onto the stack. The stack pointer is decremented to reflect the addition.
    - Conversely, if a pop action (RW is high) is instructed and the buffer is not empty, data from the top of the stack is retrieved and transferred to `dataOut`, and the corresponding memory location is cleared. The stack pointer is incremented to indicate the removal.
  - Updates to the `EMPTY` and `FULL` flags are determined by evaluating the stack pointer status.

To practically implement this LIFO buffer in Verilog, one would need to define its architectural components, the necessary logic to manage the stack operations, and ensure proper flag status updates based on the given module specifications.
