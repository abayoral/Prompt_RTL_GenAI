Assume the role of a professional Verilog designer and explore the creation of a Read-Only Memory (ROM) module intended for storing fixed, non-modifiable data. This module should facilitate access to predefined data based on an 8-bit input address. Here is the detailed specification that you need to focus on for constructing this module in Verilog:

Module Declaration:
- Name: ROM

Input Ports:
- addr [7:0]: This refers to an 8-bit address input that is utilized for selecting a specific data location within the memory. The address space should span from 0 to 255, corresponding to the 256 different data locations available in the ROM.

Output Ports:
- dout [15:0]: This defines a 16-bit output that will produce the data retrieved from the ROM at the address specified by the addr input. The data width should be precise and consistent with each memory location.

Memory Array:
- The ROM must be defined with a memory array designated as reg [15:0] mem [0:255], indicating that the ROM comprises 256 memory locations with each location being 16-bits wide. This array structure is crucial because it forms the core data-holding component of the ROM module.

Initialization:
- An initial block is vital for preloading the ROM with predetermined data values. For this example, at the very least, initialize memory locations 0 through 3 with the specific 16-bit hexadecimal values 16'hA0A0, 16'hB1B1, 16'hC2C2, and 16'hD3D3 correspondingly. Any additional memory location initializations can be performed as per requirements.

Behavior:
- The module's behavior should be encompassed in an always @(*) block. This block is responsible for continuously outputting the data that corresponds to the memory location which is pointed to by the 8-bit addr input. The inherent design of ROM should ensure that it only performs read operations, reflecting its read-only nature. This implies no write operations are allowed on this memory, and data remains fixed after initialization.

Given these specifications, construct the complete Verilog code for the ROM module that fulfills these design criteria. Ensure that the code is well-structured and adequately comments are added for clarity, especially highlighting key parts like initialization and data retrieval mechanisms from the memory array.
