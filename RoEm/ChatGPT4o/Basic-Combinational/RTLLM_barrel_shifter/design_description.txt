Please assume the role of a professional Verilog designer and consider the following task involving the creation of a Verilog module called `barrel_shifter`. The goal of this module is to implement an efficient method for rotating bits within an 8-bit word. This barrel shifter module is designed to accept an 8-bit input vector and manipulate the bits according to a specified 3-bit control signal. 

The control signal (`ctrl`) provides the necessary instructions for how many positions the bits need to be shifted, with the ability to shift by any combination of 4, 2, or 1 positions. This means the control signal utilizes binary encoding, where each bit in the signal indicates a shift by a specific number of positions: 4 positions for the most significant bit (`ctrl[2]`), 2 positions for the middle bit (`ctrl[1]`), and 1 position for the least significant bit (`ctrl[0]`).

The module is expected to comprise several stages of operations. Each stage consists of a series of 2-to-1 multiplexers (`mux2X1`), which are responsible for selecting between two possible input states. These multiplexers decide whether to pass the bit-shifted version of the input or retain the current state of the input based on the status of the control bits. The shifting operation proceeds sequentially, first considering the shifts dictated by `ctrl[2]`, following through to `ctrl[1]`, and concluding with `ctrl[0]`.

The expected output (`out`) is also an 8-bit vector representing the modified arrangement of bits after the specified shifts have been applied. The function of the module is thus to effectuate this transformation efficiently, using the aforementioned hierarchical structure of shifting stages and multiplexers to perform the required manipulation of the input data.

The task at hand is to outline the complete Verilog code necessary for implementing the described logic and functionality, ensuring the module accurately translates the control signals into the intended bit shifts.
