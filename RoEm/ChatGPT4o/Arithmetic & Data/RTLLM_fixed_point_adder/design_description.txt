As a professional Verilog designer with expertise up to the latest trends and technologies as of October 2023, I invite you to consider developing a module for a parameterized fixed-point adder, specifically designed for arithmetic operations utilizing predetermined precision. 

When constructing this module, which we can designate as `fixed_point_adder`, we need to incorporate various essential parameters and ports:

1. **Module Parameters:**
   - `Q`: This parameter determines the number of fractional bits in each operand, effectively setting the precision of your fixed-point calculations.
   - `N`: This specifies the total number of bits allocated for the fixed-point representation, encompassing both the integer and fractional sections.

2. **Input Ports:**
   - `a [N-1:0]`: This serves as the first operand and is an N-bit input, adhering to the defined fixed-point format.
   - `b [N-1:0]`: Similarly, this acts as the second operand, also formatted as an N-bit input.

3. **Output Port:**
   - `c [N-1:0]`: The result of the fixed-point addition is outputted here, maintaining the same N-bit format as the inputs.

4. **Internal Registers:**
   - `res [N-1:0]`: An internal register of N bits that temporarily holds the result of either an addition or subtraction operation.

For the module's internal logic, consider the following aspects:

- **Absolute Value Addition:**
  - If the most significant bits (MSBs) of `a` and `b` are identical, implying both operands have the same sign (either both positive or both negative), add their absolute values.
  - Align the MSB of the resulting value to mirror the MSBs of the operands, thus preserving the correct sign throughout the operation.

- **Absolute Value Subtraction:**
  - Should the MSBs of `a` and `b` differ (indicating one operand is positive and the other negative), ascertain the larger absolute value between them.
  - For instances where `a` exceeds `b`, compute `a - b`, resulting in a non-negative output (with the MSB set to 0). Conversely, if `b` surpasses `a`, calculate `b - a` and adjust the MSB based on whether the result is zero or inherently negative.

- **Precision Considerations:**
  - Both operands, `a` and `b`, incorporate integer and fractional sections, dictated by the `Q` parameter, ensuring uniform precision for inputs and outputs.
  
- **Overflow Handling:**
  - Implement mechanisms to detect and manage overflow, ensuring the computed result remains within the designated N-bit range. Monitoring the MSB is crucial to safeguard against potential overflow scenarios, maintaining the integrity of the data.

Your task is to take these specifications into account and meticulously craft the Verilog code for the `fixed_point_adder` module, ensuring accuracy and adherence to digital design best practices.
