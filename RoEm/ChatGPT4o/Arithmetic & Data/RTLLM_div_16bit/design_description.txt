Imagine you are serving as an expert Verilog designer tasked with the development of a digital circuit module. Your goal is to implement a fixed-function hardware divider with specific characteristics. Specifically, you are asked to design a 16-bit divider module, where the inputs consist of a 16-bit dividend and an 8-bit divisor, all realized through combinational logic. The task involves breaking down the division operation into a series of steps:

1. **Initial Comparison**: Start by isolating the higher bits from the 16-bit dividend, ensuring this segment matches the 8 bits of the divisor. These higher bits will be compared against the given 8-bit divisor to determine if the dividend segment is greater in value. Based on this comparison, you'll determine the initial bit of the quotient output, setting it to 1 if the dividend segment is greater, and 0 if not.

2. **Compute Remainder**: If the dividend segment is greater, subtract the divisor from it. The result becomes the remainder, which will be used in subsequent steps.

3. **Iterative Process**: This step involves incorporating the next highest bit of the dividend into the remainder, effectively shifting it left and pulling in new information from the dividend. This updated remainder becomes the new higher bits that you will then compare with the divisor, continuing the operation iteratively until all bits of the dividend have been processed.

4. **Output Computation**: Throughout this iterative division process, construct the final 16-bit quotient and determine the 16-bit remainder.

**Module Structure**:
- The proposed module should be named `div_16bit`.
- It will have two primary input ports: `A`, representing the 16-bit dividend, and `B`, denoting the 8-bit divisor.
- The output will be structured into two parts: `result`, which is the 16-bit quotient, and `odd`, which is the 16-bit remainder after division.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Your design should incorporate two combinational logic blocks facilitated by `always` blocks in Verilog. 
- The first block will respond to any variation in input values of `A` or `B`, updating internal registers (`a_reg` and `b_reg`) with the current inputs.
- The second block should methodically carry out the division operation as specified, employing the iterative comparison and remainder calculation described above.

Provide a complete Verilog code implementation for this module, ensuring that all processes are accurately reflected and adhere to the functional requirements specified in the description.
