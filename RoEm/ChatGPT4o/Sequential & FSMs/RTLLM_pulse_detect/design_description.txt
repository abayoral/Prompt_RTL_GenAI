Could you provide detailed guidance on how to design and implement a Verilog module specifically for pulse detection? The module should be capable of identifying a pulse characterized by a specific sequence of input changes over clock cycles. Let me offer further clarification on the required functionality and parameters:

1. **Objective of the Module:**
   - The purpose of the module is to accurately detect a pulse defined as a transition sequence of 0 to 1 to 0 on a 1-bit input signal. The detection should be synchronized with a clock signal and consider each change as lasting for one clock cycle.

2. **Signal and Port Specifications:**
   - The input port `clk` is the clock signal that governs the timing of the detection process.
   - The `rst_n` input is an active-low reset signal to initialize or reset the module's internal state.
   - The `data_in` is a one-bit signal representing the data whose transition needs to be monitored for pulse detection.
   - The output port `data_out` is a one-bit signal indicating the successful detection of a pulse. This signal should assert to 1 at the end of the pulse detection sequence before returning to 0.

3. **Timing and Operation Details:**
   - The module should be prepared to handle continuous input of the `data_in` signal where the state of each input bit is determined on each clock cycle.
   - The indication of a pulse (changing from 0 to 1 to 0 across three cycles) is needed, and `data_out` should specifically turn to 1 on the last cycle where the transition completes and then reset to 0 immediately after ensuring the indicator is only temporary unless another pulse is detected.

4. **Implementation Components:**
   - Define a module with the proposed name `pulse_detect` incorporating all necessary input and output ports.
   - Use a state register to track the stages of pulse detection, ensuring to include logic for initialization and state transitions based on `data_in`.
   - Implement an always block sensitive to the rising edge of `clk` and the falling edge of `rst_n` where the detection logic should be evaluated and `data_out` adjusted accordingly.

By following these functionality specifications, a complete pulse detection module can be drafted that identifies the defined pulse within the input sequence.

Please provide the complete Verilog code for the above-defined pulse detection functionality.
