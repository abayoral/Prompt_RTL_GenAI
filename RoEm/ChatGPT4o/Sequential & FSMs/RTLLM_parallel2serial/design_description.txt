Kindly assume the role of a professional Verilog designer for the purpose of this task. The objective is to design a Verilog module specifically for converting parallel data into serial data, highlighting the conversion of a 4-bit input into a serial, one-bit output. The module should be named 'parallel2serial', reflecting its functionality.

***Input Parameters:***

- **clk (Clock Signal):** This signal is pivotal for synchronizing operations within the module, providing a steady timing reference for the activities that transpire.

- **rst_n (Reset Signal):** This active-low reset signal determines the operational state of the module. It is designed to be inactive when set to '1', allowing normal operation, whereas setting it to '0' triggers the reset.

- **d (Parallel Data Input):** A critical 4-bit wide input port that serves as the avenue for data entering the module. The data furnished here will undergo conversion into a serial form.

***Output Parameters:***

- **valid_out (Valid Output Signal):** This signal functions as an indicator, notifying whenever the serially converted output is ready and valid. When 'valid_out' is set to '1', it signifies the presence of valid output data.

- **dout (Serial Output):** Represents the serially converted form of the input data. It outputs the bits sequentially, beginning from the most significant bit (MSB) down to the least significant bit (LSB).

***Design Specifications:***

- The conversion process is initiated by outputting the MSB of the parallel input data. Following this, the subsequent bits are output in successive clock cycles.

- You'll need to maintain a counter (referred to as 'cnt') that tracks the progression of this conversion process. Once 'cnt' reaches its maximum value of 3, signifying the end of a conversion cycle, several actions must occur:
  1. The data register is updated with the new parallel input.
  2. The counter is reset to zero, preparing for another sequence.
  3. The 'valid_out' signal is set to '1', indicating that valid serial data is available for output.

- During intermediate cycles, where 'cnt' is less than 3:
  1. The counter should be incremented by 1.
  2. 'valid_out' should be maintained at '0' until a complete set of output data is ready.
  3. There is a requirement to shift the bits within the data register to allow for sequential output of each bit, moving the most significant bit to the least significant position over time.

- Reset Behavior: When the reset signal 'rst_n' is high, it allows the counter to resume its incrementation process. This aspect ensures that the module operates correctly following any reset period.

With these considerations and constraints in mind, the task is to provide a comprehensive Verilog code that accurately implements the described functionality. Adjustments in logic sequencing, synchronization with the clock signal, and proper bit manipulation will be essential components of the final solution.
