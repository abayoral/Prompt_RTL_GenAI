As a professional Verilog designer, you are tasked with creating a detailed implementation of an unsigned 8-bit multiplier using a pipelined architecture. The module you need to design is named `multi_pipe_8bit`. Here's an elaboration of the components and requirements:

1. **Module Name and Inputs/Outputs**:
   - **Module Name**: `multi_pipe_8bit`.
   - **Input Ports**:
     - `clk`: This is the clock signal used for synchronizing the operations in the module.
     - `rst_n`: An active-low reset signal, where a '0' value resets the module and '1' means the reset is inactive.
     - `mul_en_in`: An enable signal that activates the multiplication operation.
     - `mul_a`: An 8-bit input representing the multiplicand.
     - `mul_b`: An 8-bit input representing the multiplier.
   - **Output Ports**:
     - `mul_en_out`: An enable output signal which indicates that the multiplication operation is active and the product is valid.
     - `mul_out`: A 16-bit output representing the product of the multiplication.

2. **Pipeline Architecture**:
   - The module leverages a pipeline architecture to enhance performance by breaking down the multiplication process into distinct stages, allowing parts of the operation to be processed simultaneously.

3. **Input Control and Registers**:
   - The `mul_en_in` signal will be sampled on the rising edge of the clock and stored in an internal register, `mul_en_out_reg`. This register governs when the multiplication process should occur.
   - Input multiplicand (`mul_a`) and multiplier (`mul_b`) are stored in registers (`mul_a_reg` and `mul_b_reg`) when `mul_en_in` is active. These registers update their values on the positive edge of the clock.

4. **Partial Product Generation**:
   - The module will compute partial products by performing bitwise operations between `mul_a` and individual bits of `mul_b`. Each bit of `mul_b` will generate a partial product, which is stored in a set of wires, called `temp`, where each wire corresponds to a specific bit position.

5. **Partial Sum Calculation**:
   - The module will perform arithmetic addition on these partial products to generate intermediate sums. These sums are gathered in a set of registers (`sum`) and updated on the clock's positive edge, facilitating accumulation and pipeline operation.

6. **Final Product Calculation**:
   - All intermediate sums are consolidated to produce the final product, which is stored in `mul_out_reg`. On each rising clock edge, this register compiles the aggregate of all partial sums.

7. **Output Assignment**:
   - The final product is output through `mul_out_reg` if the multiplication enable signal (`mul_en_out`) is active, indicating the multiplication process is valid. If inactive, `mul_out` remains zero.

Carefully consider these components when programming the Verilog code to accurately reflect the described pipeline methodology while ensuring synchronous operation and correct handling of reset and enable signals. Remember that the product's architecture is designed to ensure efficient and rapid computation suited to digital systems relying on synchronous logic designs.
