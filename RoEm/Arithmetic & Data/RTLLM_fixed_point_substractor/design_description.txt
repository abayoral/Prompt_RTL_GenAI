As a professional Verilog designer, you are tasked with implementing a module that performs arithmetic subtraction operations specifically tailored for fixed-point numbers, which require precise handling of fractional and integer components. The module you need to design will function as a fixed-point subtractor, capable of accurately subtracting two fixed-point numbers, maintaining precision in both their integral and fractional parts.

Module Name:
- `fixed_point_subtractor`: This is the identifier for your module within the Verilog code, representing the subtractor's functionality.

Parameterized Values:
- `Q`: This parameter specifies the number of bits dedicated to representing the fractional part of the fixed-point numbers. It defines the precision of the fractional component.
- `N`: This parameter represents the total number of bits used for both input and output values, encompassing both integer and fractional bits in the fixed-point representation.

Input Ports:
- `a [N-1:0]`: This input port accepts the first fixed-point number, represented as a sequence of N bits.
- `b [N-1:0]`: This input port accepts the second fixed-point number, also represented as N bits. Both inputs involve fixed-point representation, incorporating the fractional precision defined by Q.

Output Ports:
- `c [N-1:0]`: This output port provides the result of the subtraction operation, representing it as an N-bit fixed-point number.

Internal Registers:
- `res [N-1:0]`: This internal register temporarily stores the intermediate result of the subtraction operation, ensuring that the computations are carried out correctly according to the rules governing fixed-point arithmetic.

Subtraction Logic:
- **Same Sign Subtraction**: If the operand `a` and operand `b` possess the same sign, the module directly subtracts the fractional and integer parts. The resulting sign bit mimics the input sign, indicating a straightforward subtraction.
  
- **Different Sign Subtraction**: The logic must handle cases where `a` and `b` have opposing signs:
  - If `a` is positive and `b` is negative, their absolute values are summed. The output will take a positive or negative sign based on whether `a` is greater than `b` or not.
  - Conversely, if `a` is negative while `b` is positive, the same process is applied, resulting in a sign contingent on the relative magnitude of `a` and `b`.

- **Handling Zero Result**: In scenarios where subtraction yields a zero result, the module should explicitly ensure that the sign bit of the output is zero, effectively managing this special case to prevent ambiguity.

Precision Consideration:
- The fixed-point subtraction is implemented with the precision defined by the parameters `Q` and `N`. This design ensures that computations encompass the full range of integer and fractional parts within the constraints of fixed-point arithmetic, maintaining the necessary level of precision throughout the operation.

Your task is to encapsulate this logic within a complete Verilog module, demonstrating how you achieve precise fixed-point arithmetic by adhering to the defined criteria and ensuring robustness in handling various input scenarios.
