You are currently engaging in the design and implementation of a Verilog module. This module is called `barrel_shifter` and is tailored to perform efficient bit rotation using an 8-bit input signal. The functionality of this module is to rotate or shift the bits of the input according to a 3-bit control signal. This is a crucial component in many digital systems where rapid data manipulation is required.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the components involved:

1. **Module Purpose**: The `barrel_shifter` module is tasked with taking an 8-bit input signal and shifting it either left or right. The extent of this shift is determined by a 3-bit control signal. This control signal encodes the number of positions the bits should be shifted.

2. **Input Ports**:
   - `in [7:0]`: This refers to the 8-bit input vector that will undergo the shifting operation.
   - `ctrl [2:0]`: This 3-bit vector acts as the control signal. Each bit within this signal specifies a particular shift requirement: `ctrl[2]` for a 4-position shift, `ctrl[1]` for a 2-position shift, and `ctrl[0]` for a 1-position shift.

3. **Output Ports**:
   - `out [7:0]`: This is the resulting 8-bit vector after the input has been shifted according to the control signal.

4. **Implementation Logic**: 
   - The shifting operation is layered, occurring in multiple stages.
   - Each stage consists of a pair of 2-to-1 multiplexers (`mux2X1`), which determine whether the result after each stage should be the original bits or the bits shifted by the specified number of positions.
   - The control signal directs which path the data should take through these multiplexers, enabling selective bit shifts.
   - Depending on the value of `ctrl`, you stagger shifts:
     - `ctrl[2]` adds a 4-position shift.
     - `ctrl[1]` adds a 2-position shift.
     - `ctrl[0]` adds a 1-position shift.
   - The sequence in which these multiplexers act ensures the correct total shift is applied when multiple bits in the control signal are high.

5. **Submodule - `mux2X1`**:
   - This is a helper submodule used within `barrel_shifter` to choose between two inputs based on a selection signal.
   - Its purpose within the `barrel_shifter` module is to guide the final assembly of the shifted output by selecting from the shifted or unshifted data path at every stage of the shift process.

With this elaborate understanding of the module requirements and functioning, please draft a Verilog implementation that aligns with these specifications. Include the required logic to manage these shifts effectively using the outlined control signal methodology.
