    // By analyzing the Karnaugh map and using the don’t‐care entries to our advantage,
    // we can choose values for the don’t‐care cells so that the simplified sum‐of‐products form is:
    //      f = a + a'b c
    // This expression can be simplified further because when a = 0 the term a'b c is simply b c.
    // In other words, the function is equivalent to:
    //      f = a + (b & c)
    // Verifying with the map:
    //   - When a = 1, f = 1 regardless of b, c, d.
    //   - When a = 0, then f = b & c which matches the ones in the map.
    // Note: d becomes irrelevant in this simplified expression.
