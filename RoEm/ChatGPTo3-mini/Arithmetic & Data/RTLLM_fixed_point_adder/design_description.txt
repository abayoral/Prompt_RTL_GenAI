As an experienced Verilog designer, you are tasked with constructing a versatile and efficient module for a parameterized fixed-point adder, which caters to arithmetic operations with predetermined precision. This module, named `fixed_point_adder`, is designed with flexibility in mind to accommodate a range of bit-widths and precision requirements. 

### Specification:

**Module Name:**
- `fixed_point_adder`

**Input Parameters:**
- **Q (Integer):** Defines the number of fractional bits within the data representations, which effectively sets the level of precision for arithmetic operations. This parameter influences how the fixed-point calculations are performed, allowing the designer to balance between precision and range.
- **N (Integer):** Total number of bits in the representation. This includes both integer and fractional parts, defining the overall resolution of the numerical representation.

**Input Ports:**
- **a [N-1:0] (Fixed-point Operand):** This is one of the two main inputs to the module, represented as an N-bit fixed-point number. It includes both the integer and fractional components, where the inclusion of the MSB (most significant bit) signifies the sign of the number in a twoâ€™s complement representation.
- **b [N-1:0] (Fixed-point Operand):** Similar to input `a`, this is the second operand in the fixed-point addition process. It shares the same fixed-point format defined by the parameters.

**Output Ports:**
- **c [N-1:0] (Fixed-point Result):** The output port delivers the N-bit result of the addition operation, similarly formatted with integer and fractional components defined by `N` and `Q`.

**Internal Registers:**
- **res [N-1:0]:** This register temporarily holds the intermediate result of arithmetic operations before assigning it to the output port, ensuring seamless data flow and mathematical integrity.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Absolute Value Addition:**
   - When the signs of both operands (determined by their MSBs) are identical, the module adds the magnitudes (absolute values) of `a` and `b`. The outcome retains the sign from the input operands, preserving the consistency in sign representation throughout the operation.

2. **Absolute Value Subtraction:**
   - In scenarios where the operand signs differ, indicating one positive and one negative number, the module determines the larger absolute value to compute the appropriate result of the subtraction operation.
   - Depending on the comparison outcome, `a - b` or `b - a` is performed. The sign of the result (MSB) reflects the direction of the operation and accommodates cases where results turn negative or zero.

3. **Precision:**
   - By using the parameter `Q` to segment the fractional part, the module ensures that the fixed-point precision is maintained consistently between the inputs and outputs, thus safeguarding the arithmetic accuracy and reliability of the operations.

4. **Overflow Handling:**
   - Effective overflow management is integrated to detect scenarios where the result of an addition or subtraction exceeds the permissible N-bit range. The module uses the MSB and carry detection strategies to preserve numerical integrity within the specified limits.

With these considerations, your role is to script the complete Verilog code that incorporates these functionalities into a cohesive, robust module. The primary challenges are ensuring the proper handling of signed arithmetic and maintaining precision and overflow control.
