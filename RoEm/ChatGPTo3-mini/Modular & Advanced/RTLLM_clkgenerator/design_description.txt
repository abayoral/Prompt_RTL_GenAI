Imagine you are an expert in Verilog design and you are tasked with creating a specific module. The module you need to develop is called "clkgenerator." This module's primary function is to generate a periodic clock signal that alternates between high and low states at precise and regular intervals. The frequency and duration of these intervals are determined by a parameter known as PERIOD, which in this case is set to a default value of 10 units.

The module's design requires a meticulous approach to ensure that the clock signal, an output port labeled as "clk," accurately reflects a square wave pattern. This square wave pattern consists of equal duration high and low states, achieving a toggling behavior that switches every half of the defined PERIOD. Within the implementation, you'll initiate this toggling mechanism using an initial block, which will establish the clock's starting state as low (0).

Consider the specifics of how this module will interact with its environment, particularly through its single output port, and contemplate any additional factors, such as timing constraints and synthesizability, that might influence your design. How would you structure the complete Verilog code for this module, ensuring it meets all necessary specifications and criteria?
