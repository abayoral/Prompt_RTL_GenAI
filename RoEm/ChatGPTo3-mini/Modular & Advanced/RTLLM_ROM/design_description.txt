Imagine you are tasked with designing a Verilog module that simulates the functionality of a Read-Only Memory (ROM) component within a digital system. The aim is to create a module that can efficiently store and retrieve predefined or fixed data values based on specific address inputs. Here's the structured detail overview of what this entails:

**Module Overview:**
- **Name:** You are expected to name this module "ROM."
- **Purpose:** The module serves the purpose of storing fixed data and provides a mechanism to access this data using address-based lookups.

**Inputs and Outputs:**
- **Input Ports:**
  - **addr [7:0]:** This represents an 8-bit input port which serves as the address input. The input is used to specify which data location within the memory should be accessed.
- **Output Ports:**
  - **dout [15:0]:** This is a 16-bit output port designed to output the data present in the ROM at the address specified by the input port 'addr'.

**Memory Specification:**
- **Memory Array:**
  - **reg [15:0] mem [0:255]:** Your task involves defining a memory array for the ROM that consists of 256 individual memory locations, with each location capable of storing 16 bits of data.

**Data Initialization:**
- **Initial Block:**
  - In your design, use an initial block to pre-load the ROM with specific initial data values. For example, preload the data at memory addresses 0 through 3 with hex values like 16'hA0A0, 16'hB1B1, 16'hC2C2, and 16'hD3D3. While these are examples, consider how you might initialize other memory locations likewise or leave them undefined per the design requirements.

**Operational Behavior:**
- The functionality of the module includes an 'always @(*)' block. This block's purpose is to continuously evaluate and output the data stored at the memory location referenced by the address input. 
- It's critical to note that since this is a ROM, the module's operations are strictly limited to reading from memory. There is no functionality for writing or modifying the contents once initially set upâ€”the data is static.

**Design Objective:**
- You need to create a complete Verilog code that implements the described functionality. This includes defining the module structure, specifying the input and output ports, setting up the memory array, initializing the memory with predefined data in an initial block, and ensuring appropriate continuous output behavior in an 'always @(*)' block.
- Keep in mind performance considerations and ensure that the module responds effectively to changes in the input address, reflecting the corresponding data on the output port accurately.

Your ultimate objective is to obtain a fully functional and syntactically correct Verilog code that corresponds to the described details, ready to be implemented in the intended application.
