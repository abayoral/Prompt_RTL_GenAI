As a professional specializing in Verilog design, could you illustrate the complete implementation of an 8-bit unsigned multiplier using a pipeline processing approach in Verilog? The desired module, named `multi_pipe_8bit`, should operate in a synchronous manner by utilizing a clock signal (`clk`) and should support an active-low reset signal (`rst_n`). Additionally, incorporate an input enable signal (`mul_en_in`) that regulates the initiation of the multiplication process and provide an output enable signal (`mul_en_out`) to signify the readiness of the output. The primary output, `mul_out`, should be a 16-bit wide result indicative of the multiplication operation. 

**Input Specifications:**
- `clk`: A clock signal essential for synchronizing data processing steps within the module.
- `rst_n`: This is an active-low reset signal; when asserted low (`0`), it triggers a reset of the module, while a high level (`1`) denotes an inactive reset.
- `mul_en_in`: An input signal acting as a gate for enabling the start of the multiplication operation, contingent upon its activation.
- `mul_a` and `mul_b`: Both are 8-bit wide input signals representing the multiplicand and the multiplier respectively.

**Output Specifications:**
- `mul_en_out`: A signal that becomes active when the multiplication process is underway or the result is available.
- `mul_out`: A 16-bit wide output representing the multiplied product.

**Implementation Details:**
The design must employ a pipeline architecture to enhance the throughput and performance of the multiplication operation. Here's an outline of what is expected in each segment:

1. **Input Control:** Capture the `mul_en_in` at every positive clock edge to a register which will be used to control subsequent operation cycles. The output `mul_en_out` should be derived from this register indicating that the output is either available or processing.

2. **Input Registers:** On each positive clock edge, if the enable signal is high, store the values of `mul_a` and `mul_b` into dedicated registers to serve as stable inputs for multiplication, corresponding to the stored enable signal state.

3. **Partial Product Generation:** Implement a method to generate partial products based on the bitwise AND operation between the multiplicand and the bits of the multiplier. Maintain a wire array (or separate wires) to capture individual partial products relevant to each bit of the multiplier.

4. **Partial Sum Calculation:** Utilize a series of registers to accumulate partial sums. Each register should hold intermediate results and update synchronously on the clock edges depending on previously computed partial sums.

5. **Final Product Calculation:** Accumulate all partial sums into a final result to determine the complete 16-bit product. Store this result in a register `mul_out_reg` at every clock cycle.

6. **Output Assignment:** The final step involves transferring the value in `mul_out_reg` to the output `mul_out` when the output enable signal is high, indicating the readiness of the result. If not enabled, `mul_out` should remain zero or keep its previous state.
