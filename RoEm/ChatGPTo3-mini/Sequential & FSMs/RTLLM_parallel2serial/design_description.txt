As an experienced Verilog designer, you are tasked with creating a digital module for a parallel-to-serial data conversion system. The objective is to convert a 4-bit parallel data input into a stream of serial bits, outputting each bit sequentially from most significant bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB). This requires a meticulous design of the module, incorporating clock-driven synchronous operations and a reset functionality.

The specific requirements for this parallel-to-serial conversion module, named `parallel2serial`, are as follows:

### Ports Specification:
- **Input Ports:**
  - `clk`: This is the clock signal, crucial for governing the timing of all synchronous operations within the module. It ensures that data are processed in synchronicity with the system timing.
  - `rst_n`: This active-low reset signal is used to initialize the module's registers and internal states. When set to logical `0`, the module should perform a reset operation, and when `1`, the module remains active and operational.
  - `d`: A 4-bit input line that carries the parallel data to be converted into a serial form. This data is captured by the module and held in internal registers for processing.

- **Output Ports:**
  - `valid_out`: This is a control signal that signifies the readiness or validity of the serial data output. When asserted (`1`), it indicates that the serial output is currently carrying valid data.
  - `dout`: The single-bit serial data output. It sequentially provides each bit from the parallel data input, starting with the MSB.

### Functional Description:
The key function of the `parallel2serial` module is to sequentially output each bit from the 4-bit parallel input `d` over multiple clock cycles. 

1. **Initialization and Reset Behavior:**
   - Upon deassertion of `rst_n` (i.e., when `rst_n` is `0`), all internal states, including the counter (used to track the current bit position) and data storage registers, should be reset to their initial values, ready for fresh data.

2. **Operation after Reset:**
   - As the clock signal `clk` cycles, the following operations should take place:
     - For the first clock cycle after loading new data, `valid_out` is set to `1`, signaling that the MSB of `d` is available at `dout`.
     - As subsequent clock cycles occur, each lower significant bit is output in order until the LSB is reached. This sequence relies on an internal counter dictating which bit of `d` should be output next.

3. **Data Handling and Control Logic:**
   - The module should include a counter (`cnt`) to keep track of which bit of the 4-bit input has already been output. When `cnt` equals 3, it indicates that the last bit has been processed, and the module should prepare to load new data on the next cycle.
   - `valid_out` should be dynamically updated based on the readiness of the output. It is asserted when `dout` carries valid data.

4. **Sequential Data Output:**
   - Starting with the MSB of `d`, each bit should be placed on `dout` for a single clock cycle in succession. After four cycles, when all bits are transmitted, the process should be ready to repeat for new input data.

This description highlights the requirement for a cohesive design combining synchronous control logic, state management, and data manipulation, ensuring robust and reliable parallel-to-serial data conversion within digital systems.
