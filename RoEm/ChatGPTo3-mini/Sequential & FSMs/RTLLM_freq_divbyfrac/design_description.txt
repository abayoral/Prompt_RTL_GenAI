Certainly! Let's break down the request for the Verilog code into its detailed components:

**Context and Purpose of the Module:**

The module named `freq_divbyfrac` is designed to perform frequency division on an input clock signal (`clk`) by a fractional value of 3.5 times. This means that for every 3.5 cycles of the input clock, there should be 1 cycle of the output clock (`clk_div`). 

**Inputs and Outputs:**

- **Input Ports:**
  - `clk`: This input port serves as the source clock signal which needs to be divided.
  - `rst_n`: This is an active low reset input, meaning the module resets or initializes when this signal is low.

- **Output Ports:**
  - `clk_div`: This is the output port that provides the clock signal after it's been divided by a factor of 3.5, resulting in a frequency that is a fractional division of the original.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Counting Clock Cycles:**
   - The module uses a counter that counts cycles of the input clock. For a 3.5x division, it cycles through `7` clock periods (`MUL2_DIV_CLK = 7`), effectively counting double the division factor to manage both edges of the clock.

2. **Uneven Periods for Fractional Division:**
   - Within this sequence of 7 cycles, the module generates two different periods: a 4-cycle-long period and a 3-cycle-long period of the input clock. These periods originate from dividing the clock cycle count such that fractional division can be achieved. 

3. **Phase-Shifting:**
   - After determining the uneven periods, the module proceeds to create two phase-shifted versions of a temporary divided clock signal. One of these versions is delayed by half a clock period, while the other is advanced, allowing for the management of half-integer periods.

4. **Logical Combination for Output:**
   - The phase-shifted clocks are logically combined using an OR operation. This step ensures that the final output clock (`clk_div`) has an evenly distributed duty cycle and maintains a uniform period despite the fractional division.

This complete description outlines the technical approach and components necessary to design such a module using Verilog. To obtain a working Verilog code implementing this design, consider using these details as a guide in a Verilog development environment to write and verify the module.
