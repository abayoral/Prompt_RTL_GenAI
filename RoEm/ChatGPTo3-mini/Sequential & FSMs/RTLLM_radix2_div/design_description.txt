Can you provide a comprehensive explanation of how to implement a module named "radix2_div" using Verilog? The goal is to design this module to perform a simplified radix-2 division on 8-bit signed or unsigned integers. The module should accept two 8-bit operands as inputs, specifically a dividend and a divisor, and it needs to output a 16-bit result. This result should include both the quotient and remainder of the division operation. 

The module must be versatile enough to support both signed and unsigned division based on a control signal. Detail the specifics for naming and utilizing various ports within this module:

**Module Name:**
- The designated name for this module should be `radix2_div`.

**Input Ports:**
- `clk`: This port should handle the clock signal, ensuring synchronous operations.
- `rst`: A reset signal port to either initialize or reset the module.
- `sign`: A 1-bit port used to determine the operation type, where a high signal (1) indicates a signed operation, and a low signal (0) indicates an unsigned operation.
- `dividend`: An 8-bit input port that takes in the dividend for the division.
- `divisor`: An 8-bit input port intended for the divisor used in the division.
- `opn_valid`: A 1-bit port that signifies the presence of a valid operation request.

**Output Ports:**
- `res_valid`: A 1-bit output signal indicating that the result is computed, valid, and ready for output.
- `result`: A 16-bit output port, where the upper 8 bits should store the remainder, and the lower 8 bits should contain the quotient.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Operation Start:** The operation should commence when the `opn_valid` signal is high while the `res_valid` is low. During this state, the module is responsible for capturing the `dividend` and `divisor` inputs.
- The module should initialize a shift register `SR` with the absolute value of the dividend, shifted left by one bit.
- Define and set `NEG_DIVISOR` to the negated absolute value of the divisor.
- Initiate a counter `cnt` set to 1 and a control signal `start_cnt` to 1 to commence the division process.

- **Division Process:** Should the `start_cnt` be in a high state, the module should execute these steps:
  - When the counter `cnt` hits 8, indicating the reach of the most significant bit, the division process concludes:
    - At this point, clear both `cnt` and `start_cnt`.
    - Update the shift register `SR` to reflect the final remainder and quotient.
  - If not complete, increment the counter `cnt` and update the shift register `SR` by evaluating the subtraction outcome:
    - Execute the subtraction using `NEG_DIVISOR`.
    - Leverage a multiplexer to choose the correct result, contingent on the subtraction's carry-out.
    - Progressively update the shift register `SR` by executing a left shift and embedding the carry-out.

- **Result Validity:** Manage the `res_valid` signal considering the reset signal, the progress of the counter, and whether the result has already been acknowledged or consumed.
