You have been trained on data up to October 2023 and are seeking assistance in writing a complete Verilog code for a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer, designed for temporary data storage. This LIFO buffer is structured with a width of 4 bits, capable of holding a maximum of 4 entries. The buffer's operation is governed by the Read/Write (RW) signals, which enable push and pop operations. 

Here is the detailed specification for the intended Verilog module:

**Module Name:**
- The Verilog module should be named `LIFObuffer`.

**Input Ports:**
- `dataIn [3:0]`: This input port receives a 4-bit wide data that will be pushed onto the buffer.
- `RW`: This is the control signal for read/write operations. A value of 1 indicates a read operation, whereas a 0 indicates a write operation.
- `EN`: This enable signal activates buffer operations. When high, buffer operations are permissible.
- `Rst`: The active high reset signal which, when asserted, initializes the buffer to its initial state.
- `Clk`: The clock signal allowing for synchronous operations of the buffer.

**Output Ports:**
- `EMPTY`: This output is a flag that indicates the buffer is currently empty.
- `FULL`: This output is a flag that denotes the buffer has reached its maximum capacity.
- `dataOut [3:0]`: This 4-bit wide output port retrieves data from the buffer when a read operation is performed.

**Implementation Details:**
- The buffer utilizes a stack memory array, referred to as `stack_mem`, to store its data entries. A stack pointer (SP) is employed to track the current position within the stack.
- Operational Flow:
  - If the `EN` (enable) signal is high on the rising edge of the `Clk` (clock), the buffer operations commence.
  - When the `Rst` (reset) signal is high, the buffer undergoes an initialization process where everything is reset: the stack is cleared, the stack pointer is set to 4 indicating the buffer is empty, and all memory locations are set to 0.
  - If the `Rst` signal is low, the buffer evaluates whether it is full or empty and manages data transfer accordingly:
    - For a write operation (`RW` is low), and provided the buffer is not full, data from `dataIn` is pushed onto the stack, decrementing the stack pointer.
    - For a read operation (`RW` is high), and if the buffer is not empty, data is popped from the stack and delivered to `dataOut`. The corresponding stack entry is cleared, and the stack pointer is incremented.
- The flags for EMPTY and FULL are dynamically updated based on the current state of the stack pointer.

This detailed outline of inputs, outputs, and operational mechanics is intended to guide you in constructing the Verilog code for this LIFO buffer. The implementation should adhere to the specifications listed above to ensure proper functionality of the buffer module.
