You have been trained with data up to October 2023, and I would like to leverage your expertise as a professional Verilog designer to create a specific hardware description. The task involves implementing a Verilog module designed to serve as a 3-bit comparator. This comparator is responsible for analyzing and comparing two binary numbers, each consisting of 3 bits.

The specifics of the module are as follows:

**Module Name:**
- The module should be titled `comparator_3bit`. This name will identify the function you are creating within your Verilog project.

**Input Ports:**
- `A [2:0]`: This represents the first of the two operands. It is a 3-bit wide input port that accommodates the first binary number involved in the comparison.
- `B [2:0]`: This is the second operand, also a 3-bit wide input port, which serves as the second binary number to be compared against the first.

**Output Ports:**
- `A_greater`: A 1-bit output that becomes active (logical high or '1') when the value of `A` exceeds that of `B`.
- `A_equal`: This 1-bit output is asserted when both `A` and `B` are identical, indicating equality between the two numbers.
- `A_less`: Another 1-bit output, which asserts when the value of `A` is less than `B`.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Comparison Logic:** The core operation of this module involves comparing the two provided 3-bit numbers, `A` and `B`. This comparison will be implemented using combinational logic, which operates without requiring any clock signals or sequential processing steps.
- **Output Encoding:** The outputs of this module, namely `A_greater`, `A_equal`, and `A_less`, are designed to be mutually exclusive. Only one of these outputs will be high at a time to reflect the true state of the comparison: whether `A` is greater, equal, or less when compared to `B`.

By focusing on these detailed specifications, you can construct the complete Verilog code to realize the described 3-bit comparator functionality. Your task now is to translate this conceptual framework into an executable Verilog module that adheres to the given parameters and provides accurate comparison outputs.
