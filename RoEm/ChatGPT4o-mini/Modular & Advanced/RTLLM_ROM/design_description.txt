Consider the scenario where you are tasked with creating a Verilog module representing a Read-Only Memory (ROM) system, specializing in the storage and retrieval of predetermined, immutable data sets. Your goal is to design a module named "ROM" capable of efficiently handling these tasks. 

This module should be structured with specific input and output ports:
- The input port consists of an 8-bit wide address, `addr [7:0]`, which serves as the navigational query for selecting the desired data location within memory. This address essentially points to one of the possible 256 locations within the memory array.
- The output port, encapsulated in the signal `dout [15:0]`, delivers a 16-bit wide data output. This output corresponds to the content found at the memory address currently designated by the input address.

Within this design:
- The memory array is defined as `reg [15:0] mem [0:255]`. This definition establishes a structure composed of 256 discrete memory locations, each capable of storing data 16 bits in width.

The initialization of this ROM module is crucial for ensuring that specific memory locations contain predefined data. Within the Initial Block of the module:
- Particular memory addresses, namely 0 through 3, are assigned specific 16-bit hexadecimal values: 16'hA0A0, 16'hB1B1, 16'hC2C2, and 16'hD3D3, respectively. These values exemplify initial data assignments and suggest that the remainder of the addresses could be similarly populated with other fixed data as required by the application.

In terms of functionality:
- The behavior of the module is governed by an `always @(*)` block. This sensitivity list implies that the module will dynamically output the data from the memory location marked by `addr` whenever a change occurs, ensuring continuous delivery of the correct data value without explicit clock-driven prompts.

Itâ€™s crucial to note the role of a ROM as a read-only entity:
- This module is strictly limited to read operations, meaning once initialized, the memory content remains unchanged throughout the operation of the system.

Please draft the complete Verilog code implementation for this described ROM module, adhering to these specifications and taking into account best practices for modular design and simulation.
