I would like you to take on the role of a professional Verilog designer for the purpose of designing and implementing a specific hardware component using Verilog. Your task is to create a multi-bit MUX-based synchronizer with particular requirements and characteristics detailed as follows:

**Objective:** Create a module called `synchronizer` that facilitates the synchronization of input data across different clock domains using a MUX-based approach. The data will only be considered for synchronization when a certain enable condition is met, and there are specified constraints on the timing and behavior of the input and control signals involved.

**Overall Description:**
- **Module Name:** `synchronizer`
- We require a synchronizer that interfaces with two different clock inputsâ€”`clk_a` and `clk_b`.
- The aim is to synchronize a 4-bit data input (`data_in`) with the clock `clk_b`, only when a control signal (`data_en`) is active. 
- The enable signal `data_en` remains high for a minimum of three cycles of the `clk_b` clock, ensuring synchronization occurs within these constraints.
- The `data_in` changes infrequently, with a minimum interval of 10 `clk_b` cycles between changes.

**Inputs:**
1. **clk_a:** A clock signal corresponding to one domain, relevant for the input data and its enabling signal.
2. **clk_b:** A second clock signal for the domain where the final synchronization and output happen.
3. **arstn:** An active-low reset signal associated with `clk_a`, which needs to be defined as logic 0 for reset and logic 1 for normal operation.
4. **brstn:** Another active-low reset signal associated with `clk_b`, following the same definition as `arstn`.
5. **data_in:** A 4-bit wide input data signal that is synchronized across domains.
6. **data_en:** An enable signal controlling when the data synchronization process should begin, taking effect with `clk_a`.

**Outputs:**
- **dataout:** A 4-bit wide output signal that reflects the synchronized data within the `clk_b` domain.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Data Register:** The module should have a register (`data_reg`) that temporarily stores `data_in`. This register is updated on the rising edge of `clk_a` or when `arstn` transitions low, indicating a reset.
- **Enable Data Register:** Similarly, an `en_data_reg` must be established to mirror the `data_en` signal under the same clocking and reset conditions as above.
- **Enable Control Registers:** Include two additional registers (`en_clap_one` and `en_clap_two`) that manage the proper sequencing and delay necessary to respect the enable signal's pacing requirements. These are defined by the `clk_b` and `brstn`.
- **Output Assignment:** The final output, `dataout`, is dictated by the state of `en_clap_two`. When this signal is active in the `clk_b` domain, the output should reflect `data_reg`'s value. Otherwise, it should maintain its previous state if the condition is not met.

Given these specifications, provide the complete Verilog code that faithfully implements the requirement outlined. This code should describe how the data is captured, stored, delayed, and eventually output from the `synchronizer` module, all while adhering to the multidomain synchronization constraints and conditions set forth.
