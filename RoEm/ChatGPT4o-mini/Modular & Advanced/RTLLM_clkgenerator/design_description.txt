You are tasked with embodying the role of a professional Verilog designer and are required to develop and present a fully defined Verilog module named `clkgenerator`. The primary function of this module is to generate a periodic clock signal, wherein the output state alternates consistently at defined intervals. The period of these intervals is specified by a parameter labeled `PERIOD`, which, in this particular scenario, is predetermined to be 10 units.

**Module Specifications:**

1. **Module Name:**
   - `clkgenerator`: This is the designated name for the Verilog module that you need to create.

2. **Parameter:**
   - `PERIOD`: This parameter dictates the complete cycle length of the clock signal in temporal units. In the provided context, the `PERIOD` is set to 10. This implies that the entire cycle of the clock signal, from one transition through to the next equivalent transition, spans a duration of 10 units.

3. **Output Ports:**
   - `clk`: This port serves as the conduit for the output clock signal produced by the module. The output should assume the characteristics of a square wave, systematically toggling between high and low states.

4. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - Initially, the implementation should incorporate an `initial` block to establish the initial state of the `clk` signal as 0.
   - The toggling mechanism of the clock signal must be configured to switch states every half-period of the defined `PERIOD`. This division ensures that each phase (high and low) lasts equivalently for half of the full specified period, thus achieving a regular square wave oscillation.

**Request for Action:**
You are expected to write the complete Verilog code for this `clkgenerator` module, ensuring it correctly implements the defined behavior. The code should accurately initialize the clock signal and implement the toggling based on the specified half-period derived from the `PERIOD` parameter.
