Consider the scenario where you are tasked with designing a Verilog module that functions as a fixed-point subtractor. The purpose of this module is to carry out precise arithmetic operations using a fixed-point number representation with a defined level of precision. You are required to name the module `fixed_point_subtractor`.

The implementation of this module should be adaptable and customizable through parameterized values. Specifically, you'll have two key parameters to define:

- `Q`, which indicates the number of fractional bits within the fixed-point number representation. This parameter ensures that the module can be adjusted to different levels of precision required for various applications.
- `N`, which denotes the total number of bits allocated for the fixed-point numbers. This total includes both the integer and fractional portions of the numbers, dictating the overall width of the input and output data.

The module will accept the following input ports:

- `a [N-1:0]`: This input port receives the first operand, which is an N-bit wide fixed-point number.
- `b [N-1:0]`: This input port receives the second operand, similarly an N-bit wide fixed-point number.

For the output, the module will provide:

- `c [N-1:0]`: An N-bit output port that delivers the subtraction result of the inputs `a` and `b`.

Internally, the module will use:

- `res [N-1:0]`: An N-bit register dedicated to holding the intermediate result of the subtraction.

The module's implementation will cover a couple of different scenarios based on the signs of the operands:

1. **Same Sign Subtraction**: If the inputs `a` and `b` possess identical signs, the module should perform a straightforward subtraction of their fractional and integer components. The sign of the resulting output will mirror that of the inputs.

2. **Different Sign Subtraction**:
   - If `a` holds a positive value and `b` a negative one, the module should effectively add the absolute values of `a` and `b`. The outcome should be positive if the magnitude of `a` surpasses that of `b`, otherwise negative.
   - Conversely, if `a` is negative and `b` positive, a similar addition will occur, with sign determination depending on the magnitude comparison between `a` and `b`.

Special attention must be given to handling the result when it is zero. In such cases, the sign bit of the result should be explicitly cleared to zero to accurately represent zero in a fixed-point format.

Lastly, precision is a crucial element in this module. The parameters `Q` and `N` collectively define the fixed-point precision, guaranteeing that the subtraction operation retains accuracy across both integer and fractional parts according to the specified bit widths. The challenge lies in ensuring this precision without compromising the integrity of calculations. How would you proceed to develop this complete Verilog code while addressing all these requirements and intricacies?
