Certainly! To expand and elaborate on the requested task:

You are tasked with acting as a professional Verilog designer to develop a specific digital design module. This module is intended to function as a frequency divider capable of dividing an input clock frequency by fractional values, specifically achieving a frequency division of 3.5 times the input frequency. 

The mechanism involves using the double-edge clocking technique to handle half-integer division, which compensates for any imbalances in the duty cycle that might occur throughout the process. The design entails strategically dividing the incoming clock cycles unevenly and then applying a phase-shifting method, which culminates in the generation of a smooth fractional clock output.

The module, which you will define under the name 'freq_divbyfrac', will include the following elements:

**Input Ports:**
- `clk`: This is the primary input clock signal from which the fractional frequency division will be derived.
- `rst_n`: An active low reset signal, crucial for initializing and resetting the state of the module to ensure reliable operation starting from a known state.

**Output Ports:**
- `clk_div`: The output signal, which represents the fractionally divided clock resulting from your design. It should have the frequency divided by 3.5 relative to the input `clk`.

As for the **implementation details**, you are to create a module that:
- Executes fractional frequency division by employing a counter to traverse through a series of clock cycles, specifically cycling through a total of 7 clock cycles (`MUL2_DIV_CLK = 7`), as an essential part of the division process.
- Within each 7-cycle sequence, generates two distinct periods: one composed of 4 source clock cycles and the other of 3 source clock cycles.
- In subsequent cycles, produces phase-shifted variations of the intermediate divided clock: one delayed and the other advanced by half a clock period.
- Eventually combines these intermediary clock signals through a logical OR operation to arrive at the definitive fractional divided clock output, ensuring the output clock maintains a consistent and uniform period throughout.

Your task is to compose a complete Verilog code that encapsulates this behavior, ensuring each described step is meticulously implemented for clarity, functionality, and precision.
