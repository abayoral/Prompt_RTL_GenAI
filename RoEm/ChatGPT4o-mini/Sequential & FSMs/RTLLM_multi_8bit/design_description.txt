Imagine you are an experienced designer specializing in Verilog, and you have been tasked with creating a module that implements an 8-bit multiplier using the shift-and-add method, a common technique in digital circuit design for performing multiplication. The objective is to construct a Verilog module capable of multiplying two 8-bit numbers to produce a 16-bit result.

Let's break down the essential components and requirements of this task:

1. **Module Naming and Structure:**
   - You are to design a Verilog module named `multi_8bit`. This will serve as the organizational unit within which your multiplier logic will reside.

2. **Input Ports:**
   - The module will have two input ports, each representing an 8-bit operand:
     - `A[7:0]`: This is the first 8-bit input port acting as the multiplicand in your operation.
     - `B[7:0]`: This is the second 8-bit input port serving as the multiplier.

3. **Output Port:**
   - The output port, `product[15:0]`, is 16 bits wide. This width is necessary because it represents the potential maximum product that can be obtained from multiplying two 8-bit binary numbers (when both are at their maximum value, i.e., 255).

4. **Implementation Approach - Shift-and-Add Method:**
   - The module will utilize the shift-and-add technique, which is a widely-used method in digital design for implementing multiplication:
     - **Iterative Process:** The design iterates through each bit of the multiplier `B`.
     - **Bit Check and Addition:** For every bit in `B` that is set to 1, the design adds the multiplicand `A` to the partial product at the position corresponding to the current bit's weight. This requires shifting `A` to reflect its significance at that stage of multiplication.
     - **Shifting the Multiplicand:** After processing each bit, `A` must be logically shifted left by one bit position to prepare for the addition of the next significant bit from `B`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Once all bits of `B` have been processed, the fully computed product is stored in the 16-bit output `product`. This value reflects the final result of the multiplication of the two input operands.

Given the requirements outlined above, envision the design process and the logical flow necessary to construct this module. Remember, the goal is to implement a functional and efficient Verilog module that meets the specifications provided, leveraging digital design principles of shifting and adding to achieve multiplication.
