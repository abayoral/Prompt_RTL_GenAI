As an experienced Verilog designer, your task is to develop a digital design for an unsigned 8-bit multiplier module employing a pipelined architecture. This design is intended to enhance the performance of multiplication operations by leveraging clock cycles for processing and output generation. 

**Module Requirements:**

- **Module Name:** The module should be named `multi_pipe_8bit`.

- **Input Ports:** The design will include the following input ports:
  - `clk`: A clock signal that governs the synchronous operations within the module.
  - `rst_n`: An active-low reset signal, indicating with a logic low '0' state that a reset should occur, and with a logic high '1' that the reset state is inactive.
  - `mul_en_in`: An enable signal for the input that initiates the multiplication process when active.
  - `mul_a`: An 8-bit input signal representing the multiplicand in the operation.
  - `mul_b`: An 8-bit input signal representing the multiplier in the operation.

- **Output Ports:** The module will consist of the following output ports:
  - `mul_en_out`: An output enable signal that reflects whether the multiplication operation is proceeding.
  - `mul_out`: A product signal with a data width of 16 bits, presenting the result of the multiplication.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Pipeline Architecture Strategy:**
   - The module is based on a pipelined processing structure, which means that stages of the multiplication are processed in sequence, overlapping operations to achieve an increase in throughput.

2. **Input Control Mechanism:**
   - The logic should incorporate the input enable signal (`mul_en_in`) to control the flow of the multiplication operation.
   - On each positive edge of the clock signal, this enable signal should be captured and stored in a register (`mul_en_out_reg`), the most significant bit (MSB) of which drives `mul_en_out`, signaling whether the multiplication operation is active.

3. **Input Registers Configuration:**
   - Dedicated registers (`mul_a_reg` and `mul_b_reg`) should store the incoming multiplicand and multiplier, respectively. Their values are updated with the clock cycle only if `mul_en_in` is active, ensuring only valid inputs are processed.

4. **Partial Product Generation Process:**
   - The design should compute partial products by evaluating bitwise operations between `mul_a` and each bit of `mul_b`.
   - Use conditional assignments or logic structures to determine which bits of the multiplicand are multiplied based on the bits of the multiplier.
   - These partial products are managed on a set of intermediary wires identified as `temp`, each relating to particular bit positions.

5. **Partial Sum Calculation Method:**
   - Executes addition operations on accumulated partial products to derive intermediate sums.
   - Implement a set of registers, denoted as `sum`, which store these intermediate results and update with each clock cycle.

6. **Final Product Assembly:**
   - Collate all intermediate sums to produce the definitive multiplication product.
   - Use a designated register (`mul_out_reg`) to maintain the accumulated sum and update it with the sum total of all intermediary values.

7. **Output Logic Specification:**
   - Assign the final output value (`mul_out`) based on the presence of a valid multiplication result, indicated by an active `mul_en_out`.
   - If enabled, `mul_out` will hold the value present in `mul_out_reg`. In the absence of this enable signal, the `mul_out` should default to 0, signaling an invalid or inactive result.

With these directives and descriptions, the developer is expected to synthesize and code the Verilog for the `multi_pipe_8bit` module, ensuring adherence to best practices in digital signal processing and pipelined multipliers.
