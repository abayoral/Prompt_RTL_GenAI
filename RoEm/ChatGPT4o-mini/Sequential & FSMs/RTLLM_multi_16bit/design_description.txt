Could you design and implement a Verilog module named `multi_16bit` that serves as an unsigned 16-bit multiplier? This module should leverage shift and accumulate operations to compute the product of two 16-bit unsigned integers. The module should include a clock input (`clk`), an active-low reset input (`rst_n`), and a start signal input (`start`) which, when activated, should initiate the multiplication process. Additionally, it should contain a completion flag output (`done`) to indicate when the multiplication operation has concluded. 

For the input ports, you will need to define:
- `clk`: This is the chip's clock signal.
- `rst_n`: An active-low reset signal, which when asserted low, should reset the operation and internal states.
- `start`: When high, this signal enables the multiplication operation.
- `ain`: A 16-bit input signal representing the multiplicand.
- `bin`: A 16-bit input signal representing the multiplier.

For output ports, the module should include:
- `yout`: A 32-bit result signal holding the product of the multiplication.
- `done`: A signal that becomes high to indicate the completion of the multiplication process.

The implementation should follow these guidelines:
1. **Data Bit Control**: 
   - On each rising edge of the `clk` or on a falling edge of `rst_n`, an internal shift count register (`i`) should be managed.
   - If `rst_n` is low, `i` is reset to 0. If `start` is asserted and `i` is less than 17, increment `i`. If `start` is not asserted, reset `i` to 0.
   
2. **Multiplication Completion Flag Generation**: 
   - Following the clock or reset edges, update a flag (`done_r`) that indicates whether multiplication is complete. 
   - Set `done_r` to 0 if `rst_n` is low. 
   - If `i` equals 16, set `done_r` to 1, signaling completion. Once `i` reaches 17, reset `done_r` to 0.

3. **Shift and Accumulate Operation**:
   - Perform this operation on each clock or reset event.
   - If `rst_n` is low, zero out the multiplicand register (`areg`), multiplier register (`breg`), and the product register (`yout_r`).
   - If `start` is active, begin the multiplication. 
   - For `i` equal to 0, load `areg` with `ain` and `breg` with `bin`.
   - For `i` greater than 0 and less than 17, assess if the bit position `i-1` in the multiplicand (`areg`) is high. If so, accumulate the `breg` value, left-shifted by `i-1`, into `yout_r`.
   
4. **Output Assignment**: 
   - Assign `yout` the value stored in `yout_r`, representing the final product.
