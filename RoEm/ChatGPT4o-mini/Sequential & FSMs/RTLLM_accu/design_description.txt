As a proficient Verilog designer, your task is to create a Verilog module that facilitates the process of accumulating serial input data and generating an output only when a specific condition is met. This involves dealing with serial input data composed of 8-bit values and processing these in a synchronized manner driven by a clock signal. The goal of this module is to continuously gather these 8-bit data inputs until four of them are collected. Once four valid inputs are accumulated, the module will compute the sum of these inputs and produce a 10-bit output alongside a signal to indicate the availability of valid output.

To clarify, the functionality of this module, named `accu`, should be designed based on the following specifications:

- **Input Ports:**
  - `clk`: This is the clock input crucial for synchronizing the operations within the module.
  - `rst_n`: This active-low reset signal initializes or resets the internal state of the module whenever necessary.
  - `data_in[7:0]`: This is the primary data input, consisting of 8 bits, on which the operations of accumulation will be performed.
  - `valid_in`: An input signal indicating whether the incoming `data_in` is ready to be processed. It should be set to 1 before the data starts coming in.

- **Output Ports:**
  - `valid_out`: This signal is critical for indicating the completion of the data accumulation process. It should be set to 1 only for one clock cycle once four pieces of data have been accumulated and are ready for output.
  - `data_out[9:0]`: This 10-bit output reflects the result of the accumulation of the four 8-bit `data_in` values. Since each input is 8 bits, and four such numbers are added, the output width is expanded to 10 bits to account for potential overflow.

- **Operational Details:**
  - The module stays idle for output purposes when it has gathered fewer than four values of `data_in`. During these periods, it does nothing but awaits more data to accumulate.
  - Once four valid data values have been captured, the module proceeds to calculate their sum. Upon calculating this sum, `valid_out` is signaled to 1 to reflect that the result is ready and available. This indicator lasts only for a single clock cycle before being reset, ensuring that output readiness is concise and clear.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - The design involves loop-like behavior to ensure data accumulation continues beyond just a singular batch, akin to stepping through data in potentially continuous data streams.
  - Edge cases, such as handling reset conditions or dealing with synchronized timing when valid inputs are less frequent, should be thoughtfully integrated into the module's implementation.

Through these specifications, ensure the module maintains accuracy in handling the sequential nature of the input data and reliability in signaling when the output is ready with precisely gathered and calculated results.
