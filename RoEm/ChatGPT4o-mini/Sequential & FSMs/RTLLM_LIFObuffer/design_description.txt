I can assist you in understanding the specifications and requirements of the task at hand, which involves designing a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer using Verilog. You are expected to create a Verilog module named `LIFObuffer` that serves as a temporary data storage mechanism resembling a stack. Let's delve into the details of what this entails:

1. **Module Overview**: You are tasked with designing a 4-bit wide LIFO buffer, capable of holding up to 4 entries. This module allows for two primary operations, push and pop, which are governed by specific control signals that dictate whether data should be read from or written to the buffer.

2. **Input Ports**:
   - `dataIn` [3:0]: This is a 4-bit input through which data is introduced into the buffer. During a write operation, this data is pushed onto the stack.
   - `RW`: The Read/Write control signal, which determines the operation to be performed: writing (0) or reading (1).
   - `EN`: The Enable signal must be high to permit any operation on the buffer. If low, the buffer should remain idle.
   - `Rst`: An active-high reset signal that initializes the buffer, clearing its contents and resetting the stack pointer to indicate an empty state.
   - `Clk`: The clock signal that coordinates synchronization for the buffer's operations, ensuring that all actions occur on the rising edge of the clock cycle.

3. **Output Ports**:
   - `EMPTY`: A signal flag that indicates the buffer is currently empty, reflecting whether any data is available for reading.
   - `FULL`: A signal flag that indicates the buffer is full, reflecting that no additional data can be pushed until a pop operation occurs.
   - `dataOut` [3:0]: A 4-bit output carrying the data retrieved from the buffer during a pop operation.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The buffer is implemented using a stack memory array, termed `stack_mem`, which stores the data entries. 
   - The stack pointer (`SP`) is a crucial element in tracking the current active position within the stack.
   - On each rising edge of the `Clk`, provided that the `EN` signal is active, you will handle the buffer operations:
     - If the `Rst` signal is active, the stack is reset to its initial state, clearing data and setting the stack pointer to indicate that the buffer is empty.
     - When the reset is not engaged, the buffer checks the status of the stack for full or empty conditions before proceeding with read or write operations:
       - **Write Operation**: If `RW` is low and the buffer is not full, the data from `dataIn` is pushed to the stack. This is followed by a decrement of the stack pointer to reflect the new top of the stack.
       - **Read Operation**: If `RW` is high and the buffer is not empty, data is popped from the stack and output through `dataOut`. The stack memory location is cleared, and the stack pointer is incremented.
   - The `EMPTY` and `FULL` flags must be appropriately updated based on the state of the stack pointer to signal the buffer’s current status accurately.

Your task involves writing the complete Verilog code meeting all the above design specifications and requirements, ensuring the robustness and correctness of the LIFO buffer’s operations.
