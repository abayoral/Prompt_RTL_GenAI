Certainly, let's delve deeper into your request regarding the creation of a frequency divider module in Verilog, which divides the input clock frequency by an odd number. This inquiry seeks a detailed Verilog code for this specific functionality. Here's a breakdown of what you're asking for:

1. **Role Context**: You would like a solution as though it has been crafted by a seasoned professional Verilog designer, indicating a need for high-quality, industry-standard code.

2. **Module Definition**:
   - **Name**: The module should be named `freq_divbyodd`, clearly reflecting its purpose: frequency division by an odd number.
   
3. **Input/Output Requirements**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `clk`: This is the primary clock signal input which needs to have its frequency divided.
     - `rst_n`: An active low reset input which ensures that the system can be reset and initialized correctly, indicating that the counters and outputs should start in a known state upon reset.
   - **Outputs**:
     - `clk_div`: This is the output clock signal whose frequency is reduced by the specified division factor.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Parameterization**: A parameter, `NUM_DIV`, should be introduced to specify the odd division factor. It defaults to 5, allowing flexibility in choosing other odd values for division if desired.
   - **Counters**:
     - Two counters, likely named `cnt1` and `cnt2`, are necessary for counting clock cycles up to `NUM_DIV - 1`. Their purpose is to keep track of when each half cycle of the divided clock should toggle.
   - **Edge Control**:
     - The use of two additional signals, `clk_div1` and `clk_div2`, is crucial here. They independently track the behavior of the divided clock for its high and low phases, essentially managing toggling during clock positive and negative edges respectively.
   - **Logical Operations**:
     - The final divided signal, `clk_div`, results from OR-ing the outputs of `clk_div1` and `clk_div2`. This ensures that the output clock accounts for state changes during both rising and falling edges.
   - **Reset Logic**:
     - It's important that `rst_n` effectively resets the internal counters and toggled clock outputs, ensuring reliable operation of the divider when the reset signal is activated.

While this explanation clarifies the desired Verilog module structure and its key components, it does not include the actual implementation code. Crafting the complete code requires a detailed understanding of state machines, clock signal handling, and Verilog syntax, which falls beyond the scope of this clarification.
