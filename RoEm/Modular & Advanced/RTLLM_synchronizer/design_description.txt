Consider the task of implementing a synchronizer in Verilog, specifically designed as a multi-bit MUX-based synchronizer. The key is to ensure data synchronization from one clock domain to another. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the task requirements:

1. **Synchronization Requirement:**
   - The input data, `data_in`, must be held constant during periods when the enable signal, `data_en`, is high.
   - The signal `data_en` remains high for a minimum of three cycles of the clock specified as `clk_b`.

2. **Clock Domains:**
   - `clk_a` is associated with the data input (`data_in`) and enable signal (`data_en`). This clock domain manages input data registration and enable signal control.
   - `clk_b` pertains to the output mechanism. It ensures a two-cycle delay for the enable signal, `data_en`, using two D flip-flops. Finally, it facilitates data output (`dataout`).

3. **Reset Signals:**
   - Two active-low reset signals are used: `arstn` for the domain associated with `clk_a`, and `brstn` for the domain using `clk_b`.
   - A reset condition is signified by these signals being low. When inactive (high), regular operations are performed.

4. **Signal Characteristics and Intervals:**
   - The data input change frequency is low, with a minimum interval of ten `clk_b` clock cycles between consecutive data changes.

5. **Module Specification:**
   - The module is to be named `synchronizer`.
   - Inputs include two clocks (`clk_a` and `clk_b`), two active-low resets (`arstn` and `brstn`), a 4-bit data input (`data_in`), and a control signal (`data_en`).
   - The output is a 4-bit signal (`dataout`).

6. **Register Description:**
   - `data_reg` keeps the current or newly provided data when conditions allow.
   - `en_data_reg` holds the state of `data_en` to determine if synchronization should proceed.
   - Two additional registers, `en_clap_one` and `en_clap_two`, manage the enable signal delay under `clk_b`.
   
7. **Functional Outline:**
   - Under `clk_a` influence: primary data and enable signals update based on reset status.
   - Under `clk_b` influence: enable signals are delayed and data output is decided on reset status in conjunction with the enable delay signal.

With these requirements laid out, the task is to design the Verilog code that achieves this specified synchronization functionality, considering the interaction between two distinct clock domains and the need for reliable data transfer and control.
