As a professional Verilog designer, your task is to create a module named "signal_generator" which will produce a sequence of digital signals that create a triangle wave pattern. The waveform is represented by a 5-bit output signal called "wave", which will need to oscillate between the binary values corresponding to 0 and 31. Here's a detailed breakdown of the requirements:

1. **Module Definition**:
   - The module should be named `signal_generator`.

2. **Input Ports**:
   - `clk`: This is the clock signal of the circuit, crucial for synchronizing operations.
   - `rst_n`: An active-low reset signal. This means when `rst_n` is set to 0, the module should reset, and when it is 1, the reset is inactive.

3. **Output Ports**:
   - `wave`: A 5-bit output that represents the current value of the triangle wave. As a 5-bit signal, it should be able to represent values from 0 to 31.

4. **State and Waveform Logic**:
   - The module requires a state management mechanism to determine the waveform's behavior. 
   - **State Register**: This register determines whether to increment or decrement the `wave`.
   - **Wave Register**: A 5-bit register to store the current waveform value.

5. **Clock and Reset Operation**:
   - Updates should occur on each positive edge of the clock `clk`.
   - If `rst_n` is low (`0`), both the state and wave registers should reset to `0`.

6. **Waveform Generation**:
   - Use a state machine approach, potentially implemented with a case statement, to switch between states.
   - **State 0**: The output (`wave`) should increase by 1 each clock cycle.
   - Transition from state 0 to state 1 when `wave` reaches the maximum value of `31`.
   - **State 1**: The output (`wave`) should decrease by 1 each clock cycle.
   - Transition back to state 0 when `wave` decreases to `0`.

This configuration ensures that the output signal `wave` continually oscillates between 0 and 31, creating a triangle waveform pattern. Now, proceed to craft the Verilog code that implements this behavior in accordance with the described specifications.
