As a professional Verilog designer, your task is to develop a Verilog module named `multi_8bit` that accurately implements an 8-bit multiplier using the shift-and-add technique. This specific design requires handling two primary input ports — each 8-bits wide — representing the operands to be multiplied. The operand labeled 'A' is the multiplicand and is designated by an 8-bit input vector [7:0], while the operand labeled 'B' is the multiplier and is also represented by a separate 8-bit input vector [7:0].

Your implementation should include careful consideration of how these two operands interact: The multiplication process involves evaluating each bit of the multiplier 'B' in sequence. As you progress through each bit, whenever you encounter a bit set to '1' within the multiplier 'B', you must add the current value of the multiplicand 'A' to the accumulated product. This accumulated result should be appropriately shifted to reflect the corresponding bit position being processed, which effectively simulates the action of multiplication as carried out in traditional binary mathematics.

Simultaneously, ensure that after each of these additions, the multiplicand 'A' itself is logically shifted one bit to the left in preparation for checking the next bit of the multiplier 'B'. This logical shift not only helps in aligning future additions correctly but also contributes to the simulation of the arithmetic process.

The resulting output should populate the designated output port 'product', which is a 16-bit vector. This larger size is essential because it accommodates the maximum potential value that might result from multiplying any two 8-bit binary numbers. The task requires ensuring that the product of operands A and B is correctly output as a 16-bit binary vector, reflecting complete multiplication operations.

Your challenge lies in accurately capturing this shifting and adding process within the confines of a Verilog module. This means assembling the correct logic so that each operation is performed in sequence and understanding how binary addition and bit manipulation can fulfill this multiplication function.
