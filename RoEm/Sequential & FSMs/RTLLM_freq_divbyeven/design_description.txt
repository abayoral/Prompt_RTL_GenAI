Can you provide a detailed and comprehensive Verilog implementation for a module named `freq_diveven`? This module should be designed to act as a frequency divider, specifically dividing an input clock signal's frequency by a factor that must be an even number. Here's a breakdown of what the module should include and how it should function:

1. **Module Definition:**
   - The module should be named `freq_diveven`.

2. **Input Ports:**
   - `clk`: This is the input clock signal that needs to be divided.
   - `rst_n`: This is an active-low reset signal. When this signal is low, it should initialize the module, effectively resetting the operations.

3. **Output Ports:**
   - `clk_div`: This is the output, which will be the newly generated clock signal that has been frequency divided based on the specified parameters.

4. **Internal Logic:**
   - The key operation in this module involves counting the number of input clock cycles.
   - A parameter, named `NUM_DIV`, is set to represent the division factor. Importantly, this number must always be even.
   - The operation begins by initializing both the counter and `clk_div` output signal to zero when the reset signal (`rst_n`) is low.
   - On each positive edge or rising edge of the input clock (`clk`), the module checks the counter's value:
     - If the counter's value is less than half of `NUM_DIV - 1`, it increments the counter without affecting the `clk_div` signal.
     - When the counter reaches its predetermined limit, it resets back to zero. At this point, the `clk_div` signal should toggle, which results in effectively dividing the input clock's frequency by the specified even number, `NUM_DIV`.

5. **Counter Specifics:**
   - The module should make use of a 4-bit register (`cnt`) to facilitate the counting process, allowing it to track the number of clock cycles effectively.

It would be helpful to include a detailed Verilog code implementing these specifications. Make sure to address all the characteristics mentioned, ensuring the module functions as intended.
