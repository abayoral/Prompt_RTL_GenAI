You have been trained on data up until October 2023, and I would like you to assume the role of an adept Verilog designer. In this context, you are tasked with creating a Verilog module named `freq_divbyodd`, which functions as a frequency divider for input clock frequencies based on odd divisor values. This module should be designed in a way that it generates a divided clock output, achieving the division of the input clock frequency by an odd integer specified as a parameter.

To elaborate on the components of the module:

1. **Input Ports**:
   - `clk`: This is the input clock signal that needs to be divided.
   - `rst_n`: An active low reset signal that, when activated, initializes the module and resets the counters and output signals.

2. **Output Ports**:
   - `clk_div`: This is the output of the module, which provides the divided clock signal based on the specified odd divisor.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The frequency division is accomplished using an odd number, defined by a parameter `NUM_DIV`, which defaults to 5 if not otherwise specified.
   - The module uses two internal counters, `cnt1` and `cnt2`, which are tasked with counting the clock cycles. These counters track the edges of the clock signal and count up to `NUM_DIV - 1`.
   - The logic dictating the division involves utilizing two separate signal dividers, `clk_div1` and `clk_div2`. `clk_div1` is responsible for dividing the positive edges, while `clk_div2` handles the negative edges of the input clock signal. Both signals toggle states when the relevant counter reaches a count corresponding to half of `NUM_DIV`.
   - To produce the final divided clock output `clk_div`, you logically OR `clk_div1` and `clk_div2`. This approach ensures that the module accounts for both the rising and falling clock edges during the division process.
   - When the `rst_n` signal is activated (low), it should zero out the counters and set the clock divider outputs to a known initial state, ensuring the module is properly initialized and ready for operation.
