Kindly provide comprehensive Verilog code for a module named `LIFObuffer` that implements a Last-In-First-Out buffer designed for temporary data storage. This buffer should be 4 bits wide and capable of holding up to four entries. It must facilitate push and pop operations managed by read/write control signals. Below, I will outline the specific requirements and functionality that the Verilog code should encapsulate:

**Module Overview:**
- **Module Name:** `LIFObuffer`
- This module is to serve as a LIFO buffer, storing temporary data in a stack-like fashion.

**Input Ports:**
- **`dataIn [3:0]`:** This is a 4-bit input data bus used to input data that needs to be pushed onto the buffer when required.
- **`RW`:** A single-bit Read/Write control signal. A value of '1' signifies a read operation (pop), while '0' indicates a write operation (push).
- **`EN`:** Enable signal that activates buffer operations when set to high.
- **`Rst`:** An active-high reset signal for initializing or clearing the buffer.
- **`Clk`:** Clock signal ensuring synchronous operation of buffer processes.

**Output Ports:**
- **`EMPTY`:** A flag that indicates whether the buffer is currently empty.
- **`FULL`:** A flag to convey when the buffer is at full capacity.
- **`dataOut [3:0]`:** A 4-bit output data bus which provides data retrieved from the buffer during a read operation.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Data Storage:** Utilize an internal memory array (`stack_mem`) for stack storage, making it capable of holding the 4-bit entries.
- **Stack Pointer (`SP`):** This pointer keeps track of the current position within the stack. It adjusts based on push and pop operations to indicate the next available position.

**Operational Logic:**
1. **Reset Condition:** Upon the rising edge of the clock, if the `EN` signal is high:
   - When the `Rst` signal is also high, the stack is to be fully cleared, the `SP` is set to a value of 4 (denoting an empty buffer state), and each memory location is initialized to zero.
   
2. **Operation when Reset is Low:**
   - The buffer must first evaluate whether it is full or empty, influencing whether push or pop operations can occur.
   - **Write Operation (RW low):** If the buffer isn't full, data from `dataIn` should be pushed onto the stack, and the `SP` should decrement accordingly.
   - **Read Operation (RW high):** If not empty, data should be popped from the stack into `dataOut`, the stack memory for that position cleared, and `SP` is incremented.
   
3. **Updating Status Flags:** Both `EMPTY` and `FULL` flags should be dynamically updated in response to the `SP` to reflect the current state of the buffer.

Please translate the above description into Verilog code fully implementing the functionalities and interfaces specified.
