This topModule takes in a 32 bit input `a` and `b` as well as a `sub` signal to determine whether the operation is addition or subtraction. If `sub` is 1, input `b` is inverted before being passed to the 16-bit adder, effectively converting the add operation to subtract. Two instances of the 16-bit adder are used here to process 32-bit input, with the carry-out of the lower bits connected to the carry-in of the upper bits. The sum output is combined from the sum of the lower and upper bits.
