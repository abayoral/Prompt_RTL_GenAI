In the provided code, we use two 16-bit adders to perform a 32-bit addition-subtraction operation. The lower 16 bits of `a` and `b` are fed to one adder, and the higher 16 bits are fed to the other. We make use of Verilog's bit-slice syntax to accurately pluck out the bits we need. The `sub` input is used as the carry-in for the lower bit addition and also as a control signal for the XOR operation. According to whether `sub` is 1 (subtract mode) or 0 (add mode), the `b` input is accordingly inverted or not. The XORed/inverted `b` is then used as the input for both adders. The carry-out of the lower bit adder is used as the carry-in for the higher bit adder, ensuring that any overflow from the lower bit addition is properly accounted for in the higher bit addition.
