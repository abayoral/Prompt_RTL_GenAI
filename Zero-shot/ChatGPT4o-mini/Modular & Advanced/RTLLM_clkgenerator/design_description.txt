Imagine you are functioning as an expert Verilog designer. You have the task of writing a code for a clock generator module that is responsible for producing a periodic clock signal. This signal alternates its output state at consistent intervals, which are determined by a predefined parameter known as PERIOD. 

The module you are expected to create should have the following specifications:

1. **Module Name**: The module should be named `clkgenerator`.

2. **Key Parameter**: The pivotal parameter to consider is `PERIOD`, which has a default value of 10. This parameter essentially dictates the total cycle time of the clock signal.

3. **Output Ports**: The module will have one primary output port, named `clk`. This port will carry the clock signal generated by the module.

4. **Implementation Details**: Within your implementation, it is crucial to use an initial block to set the initial state of the clock signal to 0. The key operation of toggling the clock should occur every half of the PERIOD parameter to ensure the creation of a square wave clock signal with the required frequency.

Your objective is to provide a complete Verilog code that adheres to the outlined conditions and specifications, ensuring the `clkgenerator` module functions correctly as a clock signal producer.
