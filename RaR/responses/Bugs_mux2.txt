```verilog
module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out  );

    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```

In this revised version, I've corrected the output type and assignment to make sure the 'out' becomes the properly selected 8-bit input based on the 'sel' signal. The ternary operator (`? :`) is used here to conditionally assign 'b' to 'out' if 'sel' is true, and 'a' to 'out' if 'sel' is false. This ensures the correct multiplexer operation as per the design specifications. Also, note that 'out' should be an 8-bit wide vector to match the width of inputs 'a' and 'b', facilitating the output of the selected input properly.
