```verilog
module binary_adder_100bit (
    input [99:0] a,     // 100-bit input a
    input [99:0] b,     // 100-bit input b
    input cin,          // Carry-in input
    output [99:0] sum,  // 100-bit resulting sum
    output cout         // Carry-out bit
);
    // Use a larger bit width to accommodate overflow
    wire [100:0] full_sum;

    // Perform the addition using behavioral Verilog
    assign full_sum = {1'b0, a} + {1'b0, b} + cin;

    // Assign the results to outputs
    assign sum = full_sum[99:0];  // Sum is the lower 100 bits
    assign cout = full_sum[100];  // Carry-out is the 101st bit

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **Behavioral Approach**: The module uses behavioral Verilog to perform the addition operation. This is suitable for managing large bit-width operations like this one, as it allows for direct expression of the desired arithmetic behavior.

2. **Handling Overflow**: The `full_sum` wire is defined to be 101 bits wide to accommodate the potential overflow from the addition. By concatenating a leading zero with each 100-bit input (`a` and `b`), you can directly utilize the built-in addition in Verilog, which handles bitwise operations and produces the correct carry-out.

3. **Output Assignment**: The sum is extracted from the lower 100 bits of the `full_sum` result, and the carry-out is represented by the highest bit (101st bit).

4. **Edge Cases**: This implementation ensures that any overflow resulting from the addition of two maximum-width numbers is correctly captured by the `cout` bit. The reliability comes from the descriptive power of the behavioral approach which abstracts the addition process cleanly without requiring manual carry management for each bit. 

5. **Efficiency**: This method avoids initializing individual full adders for all 100 bits, which would be cumbersome and less efficient. Instead, it leverages the native capabilities of Verilog to handle wide-bit addition directly. 

This module should meet the requirements effectively, supporting efficient computation while maintaining clarity and correctness, which is critical for the competitive and precise needs of the hardware industry.
