```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module ( 
    input do_sub,             // Control signal to choose between addition and subtraction
    input [7:0] a,            // First operand of 8 bits
    input [7:0] b,            // Second operand of 8 bits
    output reg [7:0] out,     // 8-bit result of the chosen operation
    output reg result_is_zero // Boolean flag to indicate if result is zero
);//

    always @(*) begin
        if (do_sub)           // Check control signal to choose operation
            out = a - b;      // Perform subtraction if do_sub is 1
        else
            out = a + b;      // Perform addition if do_sub is 0

        result_is_zero = (out == 8'b0); // Set zero flag if output is zero
    end

endmodule
```

Here's a corrected version considering the functionality:

1. Changed the `case` statement to an `if` statement for the control signal `do_sub`, simplifying the operation choice.
2. The check for `result_is_zero` is now directly comparing the `out` to zero (`8'b0`), which ensures a clear and unambiguous flag setting.
3. Made the logic clear and straightforward to prevent any synthesis or logic errors. 

This solution should address the initial issues and ensure that the module works as intended.
