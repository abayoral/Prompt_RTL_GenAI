```verilog
module top_module #(parameter WIDTH = 256) (
  input  [WIDTH-1:0] in,
  input  [7:0]       sel,
  output             out
);
  assign out = in[sel];
endmodule
```
In Verilog, it is easy to extract a particular bit from a vector by index. Note how the example uses `sel` as an index directly. In hardware, this would be implemented with a large multiplexer.
The WIDTH parameter is set to 256 as required, but in case of requirement changes (smaller or larger numbers of inputs), it is easy to adjust.
