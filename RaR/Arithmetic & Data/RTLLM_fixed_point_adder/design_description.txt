Please consider the following task, which involves the development of a Verilog module for digital design purposes: The assignment is to construct a Verilog module entitled `fixed_point_adder`. This module is designed to act as a flexible, parameterizable fixed-point adder that facilitates arithmetic operations while maintaining a specific fixed precision. Below is an expanded description of the requirements and specifications for this module:

**Module Name and Purpose:**
- The module shall be called `fixed_point_adder`. It is intended to perform addition or subtraction operations on two fixed-point numbers, tailored to adhere to configurable precision determined by the user.

**Parameter Specifications:**
- The parameter `Q` specifies the number of fractional bits in the representation of fixed-point numbers. This parameter is fundamental as it dictates the precision level of the fractional component of the numbers being processed.
- The parameter `N` determines the total bit width of each number, encompassing both integer and fractional parts. This parameter defines the overall storage requirement and the numeric range of the input operands and the resulting output.

**Inputs and Outputs:**
- `a [N-1:0]`: This input is the first operand, a fixed-point number structured to have N bits in total.
- `b [N-1:0]`: This input serves as the second operand, also structured as an N-bit fixed-point number.
- `c [N-1:0]`: The output of the module, which holds the result of the addition or subtraction of inputs `a` and `b`, also expressed as an N-bit fixed-point number.

**Internal Registers and Their Purpose:**
- `res [N-1:0]`: An internal register used to store intermediate results obtained from either the addition or the subtraction of absolute values of `a` and `b`. This storage is essential for managing computation steps before the final result is assigned to the output.

**Operational Logic and Arithmetic Processing:**
1. **Addition of Absolute Values:**
   - When the most significant bits (MSBs) of both input operands `a` and `b` are identical (indicative of both being either positive or negative), the module performs an addition of their absolute values.
   - The resulting value's most significant bit (MSB) should match that of the input operands to ensure that the sign is consistently aligned.

2. **Subtraction of Absolute Values:**
   - If the MSBs of `a` and `b` differ, indicating opposite signs (one positive, one negative), the module must calculate the difference between absolute values, choosing the larger operand as the minuend.
   - The outcome determines the sign of the result based on the comparison of magnitudes, providing accurate representation for both zero and negative results. 

3. **Handling of Fixed-Point Precision:**
   - The operands include portions designated for integer and fractional bits, as specified by `Q`, ensuring precise fixed-point arithmetic.
   - Careful attention is necessary to maintain consistency in precision when extending operations to the final result to preserve computational integrity.

4. **Overflow Detection and Handling:**
   - The design should include checks for potential overflow conditions that might arise when summing values. The module needs to account for the scenario where the result exceeds the defined N-bit boundary, potentially affecting the MSB's sign indication.

With these specifications in mind, the task is to construct a full Verilog module that incorporates these components, ensuring the module performs the described operations successfully while maintaining all outlined conditions and parameters.
