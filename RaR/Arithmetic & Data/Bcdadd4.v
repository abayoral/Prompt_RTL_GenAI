You are in the role of a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, entrusted with an essential project that involves creating a critical Verilog module. This module is part of the development process for a next-generation product, and its accuracy and performance are crucial for upholding your company's esteemed reputation in the industry.

Your task involves utilizing an existing one-digit BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) adder named `bcd_fadd`. This module is designed to add two binary-coded decimal digits alongside an optional carry-in bit, and subsequently outputs both the resultant sum and a carry-out bit.

```verilog
module bcd_fadd (
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input     cin,
    output   cout,
    output [3:0] sum );
```

The primary challenge is to leverage this single-digit BCD adder in constructing a 4-digit BCD ripple-carry adder. The new adder should be capable of processing two 4-digit BCD numbers, each of which is packed as a 16-bit vector, in addition to managing an initial carry-in. The ultimate goal is to compute and output a 4-digit sum along with a final carry-out, following the principles of BCD addition.

Keep in mind the distinction between BCD and binary numbering systems. As hinted, the BCD representation for the decimal number 12345 is `20'h12345`, differing from its binary equivalent `14'd12345` (or `14'h3039`). The design of the BCD ripple-carry adder mirrors that of a typical binary ripple-carry adder, though it is critical to remember that this version operates in a base-10 numeral system, rather than base-2.

Here is a template for your Verilog module:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input [15:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output cout,
    output [15:0] sum );

    // Your task is to integrate four instances of the bcd_fadd module
    // and implement the logic for summing the 4-digit BCD numbers.
    // Consider the role of carry propagation through the stages of your ripple adder.
    // Begin by analyzing how each digit and associated carries interact.

endmodule
```

How would you proceed with the implementation of this 4-digit BCD ripple-carry adder, ensuring all boundaries between digit additions and carry transitions are properly managed and in line with the characteristics of binary-coded decimal operations?
