You are currently holding a senior position as a Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, where you have been assigned a crucial project. Your task is to develop a Verilog module that is critical for the success of a next-generation product. The module you are designing is a vital component necessary to uphold and potentially enhance your company's renowned reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

The specific functionality you need to implement is a "population count" circuit. This circuit's primary role is to assess a binary input vector and determine the total number of '1's present within that vector. Essentially, it needs to count the number of '1' bits. In this particular task, you are dealing with an input vector consisting of 255 bits. The challenge is to construct a population count circuit that accepts this 255-bit input and correctly computes the count of '1's, outputting this count as an 8-bit number.

Consider employing efficient techniques to handle the processing of such a large input vector. The recommendation, in this case, is to explore the potential use of a "for loop" within your Verilog design, which may assist in efficiently traversing and counting the '1's across the 255 bits.

The module's definition is as follows:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [254:0] in,   // A 255-bit input vector
    output [7:0] out    // An 8-bit output representing the count of '1's
);
    // Your implementation goes here
endmodule
```

The input is a 255-bit vector labeled as `in`, and the expected output is an 8-bit vector labeled as `out`, which will contain the result of the population count. The task at hand is to write the Verilog code that fulfills this requirement within the constraints outlined above.
