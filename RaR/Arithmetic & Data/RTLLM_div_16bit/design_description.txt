As an experienced Verilog designer, you are tasked with the creation and implementation of a digital logic module utilizing the Verilog hardware description language. Your objective is to design a 16-bit divider module, which will be referred to as `div_16bit`. This module is intended to carry out division operations using purely combinational logic.

The project's primary components involve two fundamental inputs: a 16-bit dividend and an 8-bit divisor. Your design should manipulate bits from the dividend in a manner that emulates manual binary division techniques. Here is a detailed overview of the requirements and expected functionality:

1. **Naming and Interface Design**:
   - The Verilog module must be named `div_16bit`.
   - It should incorporate two input ports:
     - `A`: A 16-bit wide input port designated for the dividend.
     - `B`: An 8-bit wide input port designated for the divisor.
   - Additionally, the module requires two output ports:
     - `result`: A 16-bit wide output port that will display the division quotient.
     - `odd`: A 16-bit wide output port that will show the remainder post-division.

2. **Combinational Logic Strategy**:
   - The division should be executed through combinational logic, allowing the outputs to dynamically reflect any changes in the inputs. The logic involves breaking down the dividend incrementally and comparing it to the divisor, determining both the quotient and remainder over multiple iterations.

3. **Division Procedure**:
   - Initially, extract the high-order bits from the dividend equivalent to the bit width of the divisor, which is 8 bits.
   - Compare these extracted bits with the divisor:
     - If the extracted bits meet or exceed the divisor, assign a value of 1 to the corresponding position in the quotient. Otherwise, leave it as 0.
   - Calculate the difference between these dividend bits and the divisor. This difference acts as the starting segment of the remainder.
   - Append the result with following high-order bits from the remaining dividend segment. Conduct the comparison and subtraction repeatedly until the whole dividend has been evaluated.
   - Conclusively, output the calculated quotient and remainder.

4. **Implementation Aspects**:
   - Your solution should contain two `always` blocks within the module architecture.
   - The first `always` block, which should be combinational, will respond to changes in inputs `A` and `B` and handle the initialization or update of specific internal registers, like `a_reg` and `b_reg`.
   - The second `always` block, also combinational, will manage the iterative division process. This involves consecutively comparing segments of the dividend with the divisor and updating the quotient and remainder until the process is fully complete.

By following these detailed guidelines, you will develop a comprehensive Verilog module capable of performing a 16-bit division using only combinational logic. This module is expected to be highly functional and suitable for integration into larger digital systems or simulations. It will effectively determine both the quotient and remainder for any input combination within the predefined bit-width limits, providing a powerful tool for a range of digital processing applications.
