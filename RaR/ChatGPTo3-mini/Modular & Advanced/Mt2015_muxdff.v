Imagine you are a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, and you have been assigned a critical task that will play a vital role in the success of a next-generation product. Your challenge is to design a Verilog module that will contribute to a sequential circuit by serving as a foundational building block within a larger, hierarchical system.

Here’s the scenario in detail:

• The overall design involves a hierarchical Verilog implementation for a sequential circuit.
• Within the higher-level design, you will eventually instantiate three instances of a particular submodule.
• This specific submodule is intended to incorporate both a flip-flop and a multiplexer.
• The module should be structured in such a way that it can be effectively reused as one of the three identical components within the broader system.

Your task is to create a Verilog module named top_module. This module is expected to include the functionality of a single flip-flop combined with a multiplexer, utilizing the provided inputs and outputs. The module declaration is already partially provided, and you need to complete the internal implementation accordingly.

The module prototype is as follows:

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input L,
    input r_in,
    input q_in,
    output reg Q
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule

In summary, you should develop a clear and concise Verilog code for the top_module that encapsulates the behavior of a flip-flop and a multiplexer. This module should later be used in a higher-level design where it is instantiated three times. Avoid providing any actual example solutions or code implementations as per the instructions; concentrate solely on conceptualizing how this module will operate within the specified context.
