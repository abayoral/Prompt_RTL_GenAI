Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working for a prestigious hardware design company, and you have been assigned a high-stakes project: to develop a critical Verilog module for a next-generation product. The output of this module is essential, and its flawless operation will play a significant role in safeguarding your company's strong reputation in the computer hardware industry.

Your task involves implementing a simulation of a cellular automaton known as "Rule 110." Rule 110 is particularly fascinating because it has been mathematically proven to be Turing-complete, meaning it can perform any computation given the right initial conditions and sufficient time.

The cellular automaton operates on a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which can have one of two states: on (represented as 1) or off (represented as 0). The evolution of this system occurs in discrete time steps. At each step, the next state of any given cell is determined solely by its current state, as well as the states of its immediate left and right neighboring cells. The transformations are governed by the following set of rules:

  • If the current cell and both of its neighbors are on (1 1 1), the cell will turn off (0) in the next time step.  
  • If the left and center cells are on and the right cell is off (1 1 0), the cell will be on (1) in the next time step.  
  • If the left cell is on, the center is off, and the right is on (1 0 1), the cell will be on (1).  
  • If the left cell and the center cell are on, but the right cell is off (1 0 0), the cell will be off (0).  
  • If the left cell is off and both the center and right cells are on (0 1 1), the cell will be on (1).  
  • If the left cell is off, the center is on, and the right cell is off (0 1 0), the cell will be on (1).  
  • If both the left cell and center cell are off but the right cell is on (0 0 1), the cell will be on (1).  
  • Finally, if all three cells are off (0 0 0), the cell will remain off (0).

Note that the name “Rule 110” is derived from translating the sequence of next states (from the rule table) into the binary number 01101110, which equals 110 in decimal.

For your module, you are to design a system that consists of an array of 512 cells, represented as q[511:0]. The system must advance the state of this array by one time step on each rising clock edge. Additionally, this module should support a load operation: when the load input is activated, the state of the entire 512-cell array should be replaced with the 512-bit data provided via the input data[511:0].

It is important to consider the boundary conditions for this cellular automaton. Since the cells have neighbors that influence their state transitions, and the first and last cells of your array lack a neighbor on one side, you should assume that the cells immediately beyond either end of the array (conceptual indices q[-1] and q[512]) are always off (0).

As a hint for testing and validation, consider the case where the initial state of the system is a single cell activated (q[511:0] = 1, with the rest being 0). The first few iterations of Rule 110 starting from this seed might evolve as follows:

  Iteration 1:    1  
  Iteration 2:    11  
  Iteration 3:    111  
  Iteration 4:    1101  
  Iteration 5:    11111  
  Iteration 6:    110001  
  Iteration 7:    1110011  
  Iteration 8:    11010111  

Your challenge is to create the Verilog module that implements this cellular automaton behavior accurately. The module should be structured as follows:

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output [511:0] q
);

  // Insert your code here

endmodule

Make sure to focus on the design and functionality of the circuit, ensuring that it correctly simulates Rule 110 and incorporates the load functionality as specified.
