Imagine you're a senior FPGA engineer at a top-tier hardware design company, and you've been assigned a vital task to ensure the continued success of your company's next-generation computer hardware product. Your challenge is to integrate an existing Verilog module, known as mod_a, into the top-level module of your design. The performance and reliability of this integration are crucial since this module is a key component in maintaining your company's esteemed reputation in the industry.

Here’s what you need to do:

• You have a module called mod_a, which has a total of six ports: two outputs and four inputs. The specific order of these ports within mod_a is given as follows:
  – Outputs: out1 and out2  
  – Inputs: in1, in2, in3, and in4

• Your top-level module, named top_module, contains six corresponding ports that you must connect to the ports in mod_a. The port names in top_module differ from those in mod_a. The required port connections are specified by a mapping between each port in mod_a and a corresponding port in top_module:
  – mod_a's output out1 must be connected to top_module's output port named out1.
  – mod_a's output out2 must be connected to top_module's output port named out2.
  – mod_a's input in1 must be connected to top_module's input port named a.
  – mod_a's input in2 must be connected to top_module's input port named b.
  – mod_a's input in3 must be connected to top_module's input port named c.
  – mod_a's input in4 must be connected to top_module's input port named d.

• The actual module definitions are given in the following Verilog snippets:

  1. The mod_a module is defined as:
    module mod_a ( output out1, output out2, input in1, input in2, input in3, input in4);

  2. The top_module is defined as:
    module top_module (
      input a, 
      input b, 
      input c,
      input d,
      output out1,
      output out2
    );
      // Insert your code here
    endmodule

Your task is to write the appropriate instantiation for mod_a within top_module such that each of the six ports is properly connected according to the given mapping. This means ensuring that the outputs and inputs of mod_a are aligned with the corresponding signals in top_module.

Keep in mind that the integrity of this connection is critical for the successful operation of the next-generation product and, by extension, for the reputation of your company within the hardware industry.
