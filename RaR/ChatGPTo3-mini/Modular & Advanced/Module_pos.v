Imagine you are a highly experienced Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company. You’ve been entrusted with the development of a critical Verilog module destined for a next-generation product. The success of this module is essential for upholding your company's stellar reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

In this scenario, you are provided with an existing module called mod_a. This module is defined with a total of six ports, specifically two outputs followed by four inputs, in that order. Your task is to integrate this module into your top-level design module by instantiating mod_a and connecting its ports by their positions. This means that the connection order is crucial: the first port of mod_a should connect to the first port of your top-level module, the second to the second, and so on.

The top-level module, named top_module, declares its ports in the following sequence: first two outputs (labeled out1 and out2) and then four inputs (labeled a, b, c, and d). Your assignment is to establish positional connections between mod_a’s ports and the top_module's ports such that:

1. The first port of mod_a (an output) connects to out1.
2. The second port of mod_a (an output) connects to out2.
3. The third port of mod_a (an input) connects to a.
4. The fourth port of mod_a (an input) connects to b.
5. The fifth port of mod_a (an input) connects to c.
6. The sixth port of mod_a (an input) connects to d.

Your goal is to insert the appropriate Verilog instantiation code within the top_module to ensure the correct positional mapping without altering the order defined by mod_a's port list. This meticulous connection is critical for proper operation and verification of your design.
