Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a top-tier hardware design company. Your current assignment involves developing a highly critical Verilog module that will be used in a next-generation hardware product. The performance and accuracy of this module are essential because they directly impact the reputation and success of your company in the competitive computer hardware market.

The module you need to design implements Conway’s Game of Life—a well-known two-dimensional cellular automaton. Here is a more detailed breakdown of the requirements and context for the module:

1. Game Description:
   • The Game of Life consists of a grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0).
   • The evolution of the grid is governed by the following rules, based on the number of neighboring cells that are alive:
     - A cell with 0 or 1 live neighbor dies (or remains dead) at the next time step.
     - A cell with exactly 2 live neighbors remains in its current state.
     - A cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes or remains alive.
     - A cell with 4 or more live neighbors dies (or remains dead).

2. Grid Configuration and Special Conditions:
   • In theory, the Game of Life is defined on an infinite grid. However, for this project, you are working with a finite grid size of 16x16 cells.
   • To add an extra challenge, the grid should be treated as a toroid. This means that the grid wraps around on both dimensions. For example, the cell in the top-left corner (coordinates (0,0)) will interact with cells on the opposite edges of the grid as if they were its immediate neighbors. Specifically, it will consider the following cells as its neighbors: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15).

3. Data Representation:
   • In your Verilog design, the state of the entire 16x16 grid will be represented as a 256-bit vector.
   • The mapping is such that the first 16 bits (q[15:0]) represent the cells in row 0, the next 16 bits (q[31:16]) represent row 1, and so on.
   • You have the option to use either a 1-dimensional array (vector) or, if you prefer, a 2-dimensional vector, since SystemVerilog is supported.

4. Module Interface and Functionality:
   • The module has a clock input (clk) and a load input signal.
   • The load signal is used to immediately load a given 256-bit vector (provided via the data input) into the grid state on the next clock edge. This is intended for setting the initial state.
   • The q output is a 256-bit vector representing the current state of the grid.
   • With every clock cycle, the state of the game should advance by one time step, following the rules of the Game of Life as described above.

5. Additional Information and Testing:
   • A useful test case to verify the functionality of your module is to use the “blinker” pattern. This pattern is represented by the value 256'h7, where three consecutive cells in row 0 (columns 0 to 2) are alive.
   • The blinker pattern is expected to oscillate between a horizontal line of three cells and a vertical column of three cells. During the vertical phase, the alive cells will appear in column 1 at the rows 15, 0, and 1 (due to the toroidal nature of the grid).

Your task is to design this Verilog module under the module name "top_module," ensuring that all the above requirements are met. The module interface is provided as follows:

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [255:0] data,
    output [255:0] q ); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule

Keep in mind that you are not to provide any solutions or code implementations here. Your focus should be on thoroughly understanding and clarifying the problem requirements and ensuring that the design specifications—including grid layout, toroidal wrapping behavior, state update mechanisms, and the proper handling of the load command and test case—are fully comprehended before you begin the implementation.
