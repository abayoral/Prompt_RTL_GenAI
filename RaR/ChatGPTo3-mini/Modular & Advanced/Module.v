Below is a rephrased and expanded version of the original design challenge without providing any code or answers:

Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and you have been assigned the task of developing a vital Verilog module for an upcoming product that represents the next generation in our industry. The module you create will be crucial to our company's reputation and success in the competitive computer hardware market.

For this assignment, you are provided with a pre-written module named mod_a, which you must integrate into your design. The purpose of your task is to instantiate (i.e., create a single instance of) the mod_a module within a top-level module called top_module. Your challenge is to correctly connect the three ports of mod_a—in1, in2, and out—directly to the corresponding ports of the top_module, specifically to wires labeled a, b, and out, respectively.

Keep in mind:
• You are only required to work with the port declarations; the implementation details inside mod_a are not necessary for this task.
• Your design should only ensure that when the top_module is instantiated, the hand-off between the top level and the mod_a module is correctly mapped through these designated ports.

The skeleton of the top-level module is provided as follows:

module top_module ( input a, input b, output out );
  // Insert your code here
endmodule

Your goal is to clearly and correctly instantiate mod_a within the top_module and wire its internal ports to the respective external ports. Please note that no further details of mod_a are needed, as the focus should solely be on proper instantiation and connection of the module ports.
