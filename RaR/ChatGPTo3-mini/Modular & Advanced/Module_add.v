Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working for a prominent computer hardware company, and you're in charge of implementing a vital Verilog module that will be part of a cutting-edge product. The reputation of your company depends on the success of this design. Your current task involves creating a 32-bit adder using two instances of an existing 16-bit adder module.

The provided 16-bit adder, named add16, is designed to perform additions in the form (a + b + cin) and has the following Verilog declaration:

  module add16 ( input [15:0] a, input [15:0] b, input cin, output [15:0] sum, output cout );

Your new module, top_module, must perform a 32-bit addition by appropriately instantiating and connecting two add16 modules. The strategy is as follows:

1. Use the first add16 module to add the lower 16 bits of the two 32-bit inputs (a[15:0] and b[15:0]). In this instance, the carry input (cin) should be set to 0 because your design does not have an external carry-in.

2. The first add16 module will produce a lower 16-bit sum (for a[15:0] + b[15:0]) along with a carry-out signal (cout). This carry-out must be used as the carry-in for the second add16 module.

3. Use the second add16 module to add the upper 16 bits of the two 32-bit inputs (a[31:16] and b[31:16]). This module will incorporate the carry-in coming from the first adder to correctly compute the sum for the upper half of the 32-bit addition.

4. The final top_module will output the complete 32-bit sum by concatenating the results from these two 16-bit adders. Although your design does not require external handling of a carry-in (assume 0) or a final carry-out (it can be ignored), it is crucial that the internal 16-bit adders operate with the proper carry propagation.

Your task is to write the Verilog code for the top_module by instantiating and interconnecting the two add16 modules exactly as described, aligning with the provided module declaration. Remember, you are not required to generate or expose any carry signals from the top-level module; simply use them internally to achieve the correct 32-bit addition.

Design the module top_module accordingly with inputs a and b (both 32 bits) and an output sum (32 bits). Be sure to follow the structure indicated in the diagram provided with your specifications.

Do not provide any code solution—just focus on understanding and elaborating the question requirements as outlined above.
