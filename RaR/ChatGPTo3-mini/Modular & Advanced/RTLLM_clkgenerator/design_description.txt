Consider the following scenario:

You are a seasoned Verilog designer tasked with creating a module whose primary purpose is to generate a periodic clock signal—a classic square wave. Here are the expanded and clarified requirements for the design:

1. Module Identifier:  
   • The Verilog module must be explicitly named "clkgenerator".

2. Parameter Configuration:  
   • A key parameter, "PERIOD", plays a pivotal role.  
   • This parameter has a default value set to 10, and it determines the entire cycle length of the clock signal.  
   • The periodicity of the toggle behavior is derived from this parameter—for a perfect square wave, the clock should toggle its output state every half PERIOD.

3. Output Pin Functionality:  
   • The module should include one principal output port, labeled "clk".  
   • The role of this port is to output the generated clock signal continuously.

4. Design and Behavioral Requirements:  
   • At the start of the simulation, the clock output should be initialized to a logic level of 0, ensured by using an "initial" block.  
   • The core behavior of the module involves switching the state of "clk" at an interval of half the PERIOD value. This toggling mechanism is fundamental for producing a clock signal that faithfully adheres to the required frequency and square wave characteristics.

Your challenge is to develop the complete Verilog code for this "clkgenerator" module. The code must strictly conform to the above specifications, ensuring that the module reliably produces a periodic square wave clock signal.  

Please ensure that your submission contains only the Verilog code implementing the module as per these instructions, without any additional commentary or explanations.
