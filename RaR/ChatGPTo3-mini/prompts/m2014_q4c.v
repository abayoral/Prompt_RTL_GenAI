Sure, here is a more detailed and clarified version of your original question, with expanded instructions for implementation. Please note that I will not provide a solution or any code for the implementation.

You are required to implement a digital circuit using Verilog that models a D flip-flop with a synchronous reset. Below are the specifications and requirements for your task:

**Module Definition:**
Name your module `top_module`. This module should have four ports: a clock input `clk`, a data input `d`, a reset input `r`, and an output `q` which represents the state of the flip-flop.

**Port Descriptions:**
1. `clk` - This is the clock input signal. The flip-flop should sample its inputs on the rising edge of this clock signal.
2. `d` - This is the data input signal. The value of `d` is latched into the flip-flop on the rising edge of the clock if the reset signal is not active.
3. `r` - This is the synchronous reset input signal. When this signal is active (assume active high), the output `q` should be set to 0 on the next rising edge of the clock, regardless of the value of the data input `d`.
4. `q` - This is the output signal which represents the current state of the flip-flop. 

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- On the rising edge of the `clk` signal:
  - If the `r` signal is high (i.e., reset is active), the output `q` should be set to 0.
  - If the `r` signal is low (i.e., reset is not active), the output `q` should take the value of the `d` input.
  
Here is the module definition where you need to insert your Verilog code to achieve the described functionality:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d, 
    input r,   // synchronous reset
    output q
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Ensure that your Verilog code correctly implements the described functionality of the D flip-flop with synchronous reset. You may use procedural blocks to appropriately define the behavior of the flip-flop that responds to the clock and reset signals.

Good luck with your implementation!
