Certainly! Here is an expanded and clarified version of the original question:

```
Expand and elaborate upon the task of designing an XOR (exclusive OR) gate in three distinct methods using Verilog. The three methods should include: 

1. Utilizing an `assign` statement to directly assign the XOR operation result to an output.
2. Implementing a combinational logic approach by using an `always` block that is executed whenever the inputs change.
3. Developing a clocked sequential logic approach with an `always` block that captures the result on the rising edge of a clock signal.

Ensure that your Verilog module, `top_module`, adheres to the following Verilog-2001 syntax:

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input a,
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always_comb,
    output reg out_always_ff
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

1. **Assign Statement**: Create an XOR gate using the `assign` statement to produce the `out_assign` output.
2. **Combinational Always Block**: Use a combinational `always` block to handle the XOR operation and assign the result to the `out_always_comb` output.
3. **Clocked Always Block**: Employ a clocked (sequential) `always` block sensitive to the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`). This block should perform the XOR operation and assign the result to the `out_always_ff` output.

Ensure each implementation is correctly coded within the `top_module` and adheres to the specified requirements.
