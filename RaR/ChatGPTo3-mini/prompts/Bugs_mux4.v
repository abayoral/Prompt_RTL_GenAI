You have a 4-to-1 multiplexer module that is not functioning as intended. The goal is to identify and correct the issues in the existing Verilog code. Here is the initial provided code:

```verilog
// This 4-to-1 multiplexer doesn't work. Fix the bug(s).

// You are provided with a bug-free 2-to-1 multiplexer:

module mux2 (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

module top_module (
    input [1:0] sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] out  ); //

    wire mux0, mux1;
    mux2 mux0 ( sel[0],    a,    b, mux0 );
    mux2 mux1 ( sel[1],    c,    d, mux1 );
    mux2 mux2 ( sel[1], mux0, mux1,  out );

endmodule
```

To address the issues in this code, consider the following points:

1. The overall structure aims to implement a 4-to-1 multiplexer using three 2-to-1 multiplexers (`mux2` module).
2. The `sel` input is a 2-bit selection signal that determines which of the four 8-bit inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) is routed to the output.
3. Analyze the instantiation and connection logic of the three `mux2` instances to ensure they correctly implement the desired 4-to-1 multiplexing capability.

Please provide corrections or improvements necessary to make this 4-to-1 multiplexer function correctly, ensuring the selection logic correctly propagates the chosen input to the output.

The main areas to focus on include the correct connections and usage of the `sel` signals in the `mux2` instances, ensuring the types and widths of signals are appropriate, and verifying that the output wiring yields the correct desired results.
