The task involves creating a digital logic circuit that corresponds to the Boolean function represented by the given Karnaugh map (K-map). The K-map is structured to simplify the process of deriving the minimized Boolean expression, which can then be implemented in hardware using logic gates. Below is the K-map provided:

|       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|
| c'd'  | 1    | 1    | 0   | 1   |
| c'd   | 1    | 0    | 0   | 1   |
| cd    | 0    | 1    | 1   | 1   |
| cd'   | 1    | 1    | 0   | 0   |

The process involves:

1. **Analyzing the K-map**: Utilize the K-map to find groups of 1's to form minimal expressions using both the Product-of-Sums (POS) and Sum-of-Products (SOP) forms.
2. **Simplification**: Attempt to simplify the expressions as much as possible to reduce the complexity of the resultant circuit.
3. **Verification**: Ensure that your reduction is equivalent to the original K-map, even if it's not the absolute minimal form.  
4. **Translation to Code**: Implement the simplified Boolean expression in Verilog within the `top_module`.

Your completed Verilog module should look as follows:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out
); 

    // Insert your logic expression here derived from the K-map.

endmodule
```

Please proceed to simplify the K-map and then translate the simplified Boolean expression to the appropriate Verilog code within the `top_module`.
