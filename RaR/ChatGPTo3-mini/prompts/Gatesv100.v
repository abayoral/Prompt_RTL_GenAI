Given a 100-bit input vector `in[99:0]`, break down the creation of three output vectors that describe specific relationships between each bit and its neighbors within the input vector. 

1. **out_both**: This 99-bit output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding bit from the input vector and its left neighbor are '1'. For instance:
   - `out_both[98]`: This should be set to '1' if both `in[98]` and `in[99]` are '1'. 
   - Since `in[99]` is the last bit and has no left neighbor, we do not need to address `out_both[99]`.

2. **out_any**: This 99-bit output vector should indicate whether either the corresponding input bit or its right neighbor are '1'. For example:
   - `out_any[2]`: This should be set to '1' if either `in[2]` or `in[1]` are '1'. 
   - Since `in[0]` is the first bit and has no right neighbor, we do not need to handle `out_any[0]`.

3. **out_different**: This 100-bit output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its left neighbor. Here, treat the input vector as circular, meaning that `in[99]`'s left neighbor is `in[0]`. For illustration:
   - `out_different[98]`: This should be set to '1' if `in[98]` is different from `in[99]`.
   - `out_different[99]`: Due to the wraparound behavior, this should be set to '1' if `in[99]` is different from `in[0]`.

The objective is to formulate these three output vectors using concise vector assignments in a hardware description language (HDL) module, ensuring clarity and correctness while leveraging the power of vector operations. Time complexity and efficiency can be optimized via vector operations instead of bit-by-bit iteration. How would you implement the functionality to generate these output vectors based on the specified relationships?
