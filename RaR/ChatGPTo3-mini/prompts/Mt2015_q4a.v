Certainly! Let's expand and clarify the provided question:

You are tasked with designing a digital module named `top_module` using Verilog. This module should take two input signals, `x` and `y`, and produce an output signal, `z`. The functionality you need to implement is defined by the expression `z = (x ^ y) & x`, where `^` represents the bitwise XOR operation and `&` represents the bitwise AND operation.

Here is the initial template of the module as a starting point:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input x,   // First input signal
    input y,   // Second input signal
    output z   // Output signal that is defined by the expression z = (x ^ y) & x
);

// Add your implementation of the function z = (x ^ y) & x here

endmodule
```

To summarize, your task is to write the necessary Verilog code within the module to correctly compute the output `z` based on the inputs `x` and `y` using the given expression. Please focus on ensuring the functionality of the expression is accurately represented in your implementation.
