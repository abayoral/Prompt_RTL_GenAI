**Question: Implementing a Two-Bit Saturating Counter in Verilog**

You are tasked with building a two-bit saturating counter using Verilog. The counter should operate according to the following rules:

1. **Incrementing the Counter:**
   - The counter should increment by 1 (but not exceed a maximum value of 3) when both `train_valid` and `train_taken` signals are `1`.

2. **Decrementing the Counter:**
   - The counter should decrement by 1 (but not go below a minimum value of 0) when `train_valid` is `1` and `train_taken` is `0`.

3. **Maintaining Value When Not Training:**
   - If the `train_valid` signal is `0`, the counter should retain its current value, irrespective of the `train_taken` signal.

4. **Asynchronous Reset:**
   - There is an asynchronous reset signal (`areset`) which, when active, should reset the counter to a state of weakly not-taken (`2'b01`), regardless of the clock signal.

5. **Output:**
   - The current value of the counter should be output via a 2-bit wide signal named `state`.

**Verilog Module Specification:**

You should implement the counter within the following module template:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,           // Clock signal
    input areset,        // Asynchronous reset signal
    input train_valid,   // Signal to indicate if training is valid
    input train_taken,   // Signal to indicate if the branch is taken
    output reg [1:0] state  // 2-bit output signal representing the counter value
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

**Key Points to Consider:**
- Remember to handle the asynchronous reset (`areset`) appropriately so that it resets the counter to the specified state (`weakly not-taken`, which is `2'b01`).
- Ensure that the state updates correctly on the positive edge of the clock signal when `areset` is not active.
- Handle the case where the counter should neither increment nor decrement when `train_valid` is `0`.

Your task is to fill in the detailed logic inside the provided module template to meet the specified requirements.
