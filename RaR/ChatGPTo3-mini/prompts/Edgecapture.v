Certainly! Here is a rephrased and expanded version of your question:


// Design a hardware module that processes a 32-bit input signal and detects transitions from 1 to 0 for each individual bit in that signal. Specifically, for each bit in the 32-bit input vector, we need to identify when the bit transitions from 1 in one clock cycle to 0 in the subsequent clock cycle. Upon detecting such a transition, the corresponding output bit should be set to 1 and remain 1 until a synchronous reset signal is asserted, at which point the output should be reset to 0.
// 
// Each bit in the output vector essentially behaves like an SR (Set-Reset) flip-flop. Here's a detailed description of the desired behavior:
// 
// 1. **Set Condition**: An output bit should be set to 1 at the positive edge of the clock cycle immediately following a detected 1-to-0 transition for the corresponding bit in the input vector.
// 2. **Reset Condition**: The output bit should be reset to 0 at the positive clock edge when the `reset` signal is high. This reset action should take precedence over the set condition if both conditions occur simultaneously.
// 
// As an example, consider a waveform where the `reset` event occurs one cycle earlier than the `set` event for the last four cycles. In this case, there should be no conflict because reset has higher priority over set.
// 
// Implement the described functionality within the module `top_module` with the following interface:
// 
// ```verilog
// module top_module (
//     input clk,
//     input reset,
//     input [31:0] in,
//     output [31:0] out
// );
//     // Insert your code here
// endmodule
// ```
// 
// This module will take the following inputs:
// - `clk`: The clock signal.
// - `reset`: The synchronous reset signal.
// - `in`: A 32-bit input vector whose individual bits will be monitored for 1-to-0 transitions.
// 
// The module will produce the following outputs:
// - `out`: A 32-bit output vector, where each bit corresponds to whether a 1-to-0 transition has been detected for the respective bit in the input vector. Each output bit will stay high until the reset signal is asserted.
// 
// Your task is to complete the implementation inside the module to achieve the described behavior.
