Certainly! Hereâ€™s the revised question with more detailed explanations:

Design and implement a 100-bit rotator module with both left and right rotation capabilities, along with synchronous load and direction enable functionality. Unlike a conventional shift register, a rotator "wraps around" bits that are shifted out from one end and reintroduces them at the opposite end, thus preserving all bit values during shifts.

Functionality Requirements:
1. **Load Operation**: When the `load` signal is active (asserted), the module should reload the rotator with the provided 100-bit input data (`data[99:0]`) instead of performing any rotation.
2. **Enable (`ena`)**:
   - `ena[1:0] = 2'b01`: The contents of the register should rotate to the right by one bit position.
   - `ena[1:0] = 2'b10`: The contents of the register should rotate to the left by one bit position.
   - `ena[1:0] = 2'b00` or `ena[1:0] = 2'b11`: No rotation should occur, and the register maintains its current state.

Output:
- `q`: A 100-bit wide register output which holds the current state of the rotator.

Implementation Constraints:
- The design should utilize synchronous operations controlled by the clock signal `clk`.
- The `load` signal has priority over the rotation control `ena`.

Code Scaffold:
```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,             // Clock signal
    input load,            // Synchronous load signal
    input [1:0] ena,       // 2-bit enable signal to control rotation direction
    input [99:0] data,     // 100-bit input data for loading
    output reg [99:0] q    // 100-bit rotator register output
); 

    // Insert your code here to implement the synchronous load and rotation functionalities

endmodule
```

With this structure in mind, ensure the design correctly discriminates between the load operation and rotation operations, and implements the wrapping-around behavior characteristic of a rotator, rather than the zero-filling behavior typical of a shifter.
