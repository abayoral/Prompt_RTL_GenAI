We are designing a timer circuit that operates based on specific input sequences, with the following detailed steps and behavior:

1. **Input Detection Initialization**: The timer circuit should begin in a state where it continuously monitors the serial data input pin for the arrival of a specific 4-bit sequence, '1101'. This sequence serves as the trigger to start the timer.
  
2. **Pattern Recognition and Duration Setting**: Once the '1101' pattern is detected on the serial data input, the circuit should then proceed to shift in the next 4 bits from the serial data input. These 4 bits, which reside in the order from most-significant-bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB), are used to determine the duration for which the timer should delay. This 4-bit value is referred to as `delay[3:0]`.

3. **Counting State**: Upon capturing the `delay[3:0]` value, the circuit transitions to a counting phase. During this phase, a counter is initialized, and the circuit remains in this counting state for a duration calculated as (delay + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. For instance, if `delay = 0`, the timer counts for 1000 clock cycles, and if `delay = 5`, the timer counts for 6000 clock cycles. Throughout this phase, the output `count[3:0]` should reflect the remaining time, decrementing once every 1000 clock cycles. For example, if `delay = 3`, `count` will be 3 for the first 1000 cycles, then 2 for the next 1000 cycles, and so on, until it reaches 0.

4. **Completion and User Notification**: Once the counter completes the specified duration, the circuit should assert a 'done' signal to notify the user that the timer has expired. 

5. **User Acknowledgment**: The circuit then awaits an acknowledgment input (`ack`), indicating the user has accepted the timeout notification. Once `ack` is received, the circuit resets and begins searching for the next occurrence of the '1101' start sequence on the data input.

6. **Initial and Reset State**: The circuit should be capable of resetting to an initial state, where it resumes searching for the '1101' input pattern after the user acknowledgment.

**Implementation Hint**: You are encouraged to implement the entire logic within a single module. However, it is crucial to maintain clarity by separating the different logical blocks (e.g., pattern detector, bit shifter, counter, state machine) into distinct `always` blocks within the module. Avoid merging multiple `always` blocks, as this can lead to confusion and potential errors.

Here's the module header, where you will implement these functionalities:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,      // Synchronous reset
    input data,
    output [3:0] count,
    output counting,
    output done,
    input ack );

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

This should give a comprehensive understanding of how to approach the problem and what functionality needs to be implemented in each step.
