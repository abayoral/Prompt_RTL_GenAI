Imagine you are an experienced Digital Design Engineer working for a top-tier hardware company. Your assignment is to develop an essential Verilog module that is critical for an upcoming product in our next-generation lineup. This module is not only complex but also vital for ensuring that our company's standing in the computer hardware industry remains strong.

Your task is to implement the logic circuit as defined by the following Karnaugh map:

──────────────────────────────
           a'b'   a'b   ab   ab'
──────────────────────────────
c'd'   |     1     1    0    1
c'd    |     1     0    0    1
cd     |     0     1    1    1
cd'    |     1     1    0    0
──────────────────────────────

As you proceed, consider the following requirements:

1. Begin by simplifying the Karnaugh map. Explore both the product-of-sums (POS) and sum-of-products (SOP) methods in your simplification process. While the goal is to achieve the most efficient design, note that the optimization level will be verified by comparing the reduced implementation against the original logic definitions rather than only relying on pure minimalism.

2. After simplifying the logic, translate your simplified logic expression into a Verilog module. Use the following module template:

   module top_module(
       input  a,
       input  b,
       input  c,
       input  d,
       output out
   );
       // Your Verilog code implementation should be inserted here
   endmodule

3. The purpose of your implementation is to accurately reflect the circuit specified by the Karnaugh map. Therefore, you should demonstrate not only your ability to simplify the logic but also your skill in converting that simplified logic into a structurally correct and functionally accurate Verilog design.

Your challenge is to show that you understand how to move from a graphical logic representation (the Karnaugh map) to an optimally simplified Boolean expression (in both product-of-sums and sum-of-products forms), and finally into a ready-to-synthesize digital circuit coded in Verilog.
