Imagine you're a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company. Your challenge is to develop a Verilog module that replicates the behavior of the 7420 integrated circuit—a part of the classic 7400-series chips which consist of digital gates. The 7420, in particular, comprises two distinct 4-input NAND gates. This module must accept a total of eight input signals and produce two corresponding outputs, where each output represents the result of a 4-input NAND operation on its designated set of inputs.

The task is to implement a Verilog module named "top_module" that exactly mirrors the functionality of the 7420 chip. The module should have the following interface:

• Two groups of input signals:
  - The first group includes p1a, p1b, p1c, and p1d.
  - The second group comprises p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d.
  
• Two output signals:
  - p1y should deliver the result of the NAND operation on the first group of inputs.
  - p2y should output the result of the NAND operation on the second group of inputs.

The essence of the task is to ensure that you correctly compute the NAND functions for both groups and drive the output signals accordingly. No additional functionality beyond simulating the two 4-input NAND gates is required.

You are not expected to provide any implementation details at this point; rather, the focus should be on clearly understanding and defining the problem based on the given constraints and interface requirements.
