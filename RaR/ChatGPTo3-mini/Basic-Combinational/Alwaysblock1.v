Imagine you are an experienced Digital Design Engineer working at a top-tier hardware design company. Your current mission is to create a vital Verilog module for a cutting-edge product, where your implementation is critical to uphold the companyâ€™s prestigious reputation in the computer hardware industry.

Your task is to implement an AND gate that computes the logical AND of two input signals (a and b) using two distinct techniques within the same module:

1. Use an assign statement to drive the output.
2. Use a combinational always block to drive another output.

Below is the starting template of the Verilog module. You need to complete the module by coding both versions of the AND gate implementation:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input a, 
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,     // Output via assign statement
    output reg out_alwaysblock  // Output via combinational always block
);

    // Insert your code here to implement the AND gate using both methods

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Focus on ensuring that both implementations correctly compute a AND b. Provide clear and well-structured Verilog code that adheres to the Verilog 2001 standard. Remember that the module's design and functionality are essential in the context of the next-generation hardware product.
