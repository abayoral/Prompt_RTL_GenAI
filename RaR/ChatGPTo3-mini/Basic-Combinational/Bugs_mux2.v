A leading computer hardware company is counting on you, a seasoned Digital Design Engineer, to develop a high-performance Verilog module for an upcoming generation of products. The reputation of the company in the industry hinges on the success of this module. The task at hand involves an 8-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer, which is currently not performing as expected. Your objective is to thoroughly examine the provided Verilog code to pinpoint and correct any errors that might be preventing the multiplexer from functioning correctly.

Below is the Verilog code for the multiplexer module:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input sel,            // Selector signal to choose between the two inputs
    input [7:0] a,        // 8-bit input 'a'
    input [7:0] b,        // 8-bit input 'b'
    output out            // Output signal (expected to be 8 bits wide)
);

    assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Notice that the module is intended to handle 8-bit data paths, yet the output port 'out' is defined without specifying its 8-bit width. Your challenge is to identify the source of the malfunction in this implementation and make the necessary modifications to ensure that the multiplexer correctly switches between the two 8-bit inputs based on the selector signal.

Restate the problem in your own words, and provide a detailed explanation of how you would approach identifying and resolving the bugâ€”without including the actual fix or code solution.
