Imagine you're a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prestigious hardware design firm, and your responsibility is to develop a vital Verilog module for an upcoming cutting-edge product. The success of this module is critical, as it plays a major role in maintaining the strong reputation of your company in the computer hardware industry.

In this assignment, you are asked to design a Verilog module that represents a very simple digital circuit. The circuit is notable for having no input signals and just a single output. This output must consistently be at a logic high level (representing the value 1) at all times.

The provided Verilog code outlines the basic module structure with a placeholder within an assign statement. Your task is to correctly modify this placeholder so that the module meets the requirement of continuously driving the output high. Consider the simplicity of the circuit design, as it doesn't rely on any incoming signals or dynamic logic.

Remember, the goal is to clearly articulate a module that effectively produces a constant logic high on its sole output. This task requires attention to ensuring that the Verilog module is synthesized as intended in the design environment of your next-generation hardware project.
