The task is to design a combinational circuit using Verilog that accepts two primary input signals, labeled "a" and "b," and produces seven distinct outputs driven by different logic gate operations. As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, you are charged with implementing this critical module for a next-generation product—an effort that is pivotal to upholding your company’s reputation in the competitive computer hardware market.

Your Verilog module should declare the two inputs "a" and "b," and it should generate the following seven outputs with their respective logical functions:

1. out_and: This output should represent the logical AND operation between inputs "a" and "b."
2. out_or: This output should represent the logical OR operation between inputs "a" and "b."
3. out_xor: This output should represent the logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation between inputs "a" and "b."
4. out_nand: This output should represent the negated result of the logical AND operation (NAND) on inputs "a" and "b."
5. out_nor: This output should represent the negated result of the logical OR operation (NOR) on inputs "a" and "b."
6. out_xnor: This output should represent the logical XNOR (exclusive NOR) operation between inputs "a" and "b."
7. out_anotb: This output should produce a result where "a" is combined with the negation of "b" (i.e., a AND NOT b).

You are required to develop this module within the structure of a top-level Verilog module, which is provided with the corresponding input and output port declarations. Expand your implementation by inserting the appropriate Verilog logic that ensures each output reflects the described gate-driven behavior. 

Ensure that your module is purely combinational—meaning that the outputs must be generated solely based on the current inputs without any memory or clock dependency.

Remember, this question focuses on both the correct application of logical operators in Verilog and the clarity of your hardware description code to meet the high reliability standards expected in next-generation computer hardware design.
