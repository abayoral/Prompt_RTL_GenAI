Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, responsible for developing a critical Verilog module for an upcoming next-generation product. This module plays a key role in upholding the company's reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

Your assignment involves working with multiple input vectors that need to be processed in a specific manner. You are provided with six distinct input vectors, each 5 bits wide—named a, b, c, d, e, and f. Together, these vectors form a combined total of 30 input bits when concatenated. The task is to combine these six vectors in a defined sequence and then append an additional two binary '1' bits, resulting in an aggregated 32-bit output stream.

This 32-bit result is not used as a single vector but must be partitioned into four separate 8-bit output vectors, which are designated as w, x, y, and z. The challenge lies in appropriately concatenating the six 5-bit inputs along with the two extra '1' bits and then correctly splitting this new 32-bit vector into the required four 8-bit segments.

The Verilog module structure is provided, and you are expected to complete the code by inserting the necessary assignments to achieve the described functionality. Focus on ensuring that the concatenation of input vectors, the addition of the two '1' bits, and the distribution across the four output vectors (w, x, y, z) adhere exactly to the requirements specified.
