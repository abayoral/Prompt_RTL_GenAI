Imagine you are working as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a renowned hardware design company, where you are under pressure to develop a pivotal Verilog module for an upcoming generation of high-performance products. Your reputation—and that of your company—hinges on the flawless operation of each design component. You have been given a Verilog implementation of a 4-to-1 multiplexer, which is intended to be built using a bug-free 2-to-1 multiplexer module provided to you. However, the current implementation of the 4-to-1 multiplexer is not working as expected.

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided Verilog code, pinpoint the issues that are preventing the 4-to-1 multiplexer from functioning correctly, and make the necessary corrections. The design involves instantiating and interconnecting multiple 2-to-1 multiplexer modules, each handling 8-bit inputs, through the use of selection signals. The errors could be related to module instantiation, wiring, signal naming or typing, or other integration aspects.

To summarize, you need to:
• Examine the given 4-to-1 multiplexer code alongside the provided bug-free 2-to-1 multiplexer.
• Investigate and identify any bugs or discrepancies in the implementation (such as incorrect signal connections, naming conflicts, or improper module instantiations).
• Modify the code accordingly so that this multiplexer properly routes one of the four 8-bit inputs to the output based on the selection bits.

This question challenges you to apply your expertise in digital design and Verilog coding to ensure that the hierarchical design integrates correctly, thereby upholding the stringent quality standards required for a next-generation hardware product.
