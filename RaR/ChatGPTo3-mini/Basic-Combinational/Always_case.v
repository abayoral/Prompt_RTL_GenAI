Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and you've been assigned a crucial task for your next-generation product. Your objective is to design a Verilog module that implements a 6-to-1 multiplexer using a case statement—this approach is particularly suited for handling multiple cases efficiently, compared to a series of if statements.

In this design exercise, you are provided with the following key details:

• The multiplexer must select one of six 4-bit data inputs based on a 3-bit selection signal. If the selection signal (sel) is within the range of 0 to 5, the corresponding data input should be routed to the output.

• If the selection signal falls outside this valid range, the multiplexer should output 0 (a 4-bit zero value).

• The design must be implemented as a combinational circuit, meaning that you should use an always block sensitive to all inputs (always @(*)), and you need to take special care to avoid inadvertently inferring latches.

• You are encouraged to use a case statement for this implementation due to its clarity and efficiency when handling multiple selection conditions.

• The provided module skeleton specifies that both the data inputs and outputs are 4 bits wide.

Your task is to elaborate on the Verilog code inside the always block by writing a case statement that correctly maps each valid selection (sel values between 0 and 5) to its corresponding data input, and ensures that any other sel value results in an output of 0.

Please focus solely on understanding and clarifying the requirements of this multiplexer design. Do not attempt to provide any solutions or implementation details at this stage.
