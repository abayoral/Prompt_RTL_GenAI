Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a top-tier hardware design company. Your latest assignment involves designing a Verilog module that plays a crucial role in the performance of a next-generation product. The success of this module is essential to uphold the company's esteemed reputation in the computer hardware industry.

Your task is to create a Verilog module that determines the minimum value among four given unsigned 8-bit numbers named a, b, c, and d. Since these are unsigned numbers, you can directly compare them using standard comparison operators (for example, a < b is valid). The approach recommended is to utilize the conditional (ternary) operator to construct two-input minimum (min) circuits. Once you have these simpler two-way min circuits, you should combine them to build a more complex circuit capable of selecting the minimum of all four numbers.

To summarize, you need to:
1. Develop a two-input min circuit using the conditional operator.
2. Combine multiple instances of such two-input circuits to generate a 4-way min circuit.
3. Make use of intermediate wire vectors to hold intermediate results during the computation.

This module should be encapsulated within a Verilog file (module top_module) with the four 8-bit inputs (a, b, c, d) and a single 8-bit output signal (min) that represents the smallest value among the inputs.
