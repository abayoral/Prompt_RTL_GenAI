Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a top-tier hardware development firm. You have been given a critical task: to design a Verilog module that will be a cornerstone in the next-generation product your company is preparing to launch. The performance and reliability of this module are of utmost importance, as they directly influence your company’s esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware market.

The challenge revolves around implementing a specific logic function, referred to as f, which is defined by a Karnaugh map provided below. The Karnaugh map organizes the values of f based on four input variables labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, and x₄:

    x₁'x₂'  x₁'x₂  x₁x₂  x₁x₂'
x₃'x₄'  d    0    d    d
x₃'x₄  0    d    1    0
x₃x₄   1    1    d    d
x₃x₄'  1    1    0    d

In this diagram, the symbol “d” represents a don’t-care condition, meaning that for these specific input combinations, you have the freedom to choose any output value that would simplify the design or be most advantageous for your implementation.

Your task is to develop the Verilog module named top_module. This module should take a 4-bit input (with the bits corresponding to x₁ through x₄) and produce an output f that correctly implements the logic function as laid out by the Karnaugh map. The don’t-care conditions are provided to allow design flexibility, so you may assign them values that best meet your design objectives without compromising the desired functionality.

Note: The focus is solely on accurately interpreting and elaborating on the task description. You are not required to provide the actual Verilog code or any implementation details at this stage.
