Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a top-tier hardware design firm, and your expertise has been called upon to craft a crucial Verilog module that is central to a new cellphone product. The reputation of your company rests on ensuring this module functions flawlessly. Your task is to design a circuit that governs the behavior of a cellphone’s ringer and vibration motor. The circuit should meet the following criteria:

1. When there is an incoming call (indicated by the input signal "ring") to the cellphone, the circuit must activate either the ringer (by setting the output "ringer" to 1) or the vibration motor (by setting the output "motor" to 1). Importantly, both outputs must never be active simultaneously.

2. The decision on which component to activate depends on the phone’s mode: if the phone is set to vibrate mode (indicated by the input signal "vibrate_mode" being 1), then only the motor should be activated. Conversely, if the phone is not in vibrate mode, then the ringer should be activated.

The challenge is to implement this behavior using only assign statements, essentially translating the problem specification directly into a set of logic gate connections within the Verilog module.

Keep in mind the perspective shift common in hardware design: rather than sequentially processing inputs to produce outputs (as you might in a typical programming scenario), you need to define how the outputs directly relate to the inputs. In this approach, think about specifying the exact conditions under which the motor will be on and, by inference, when the ringer will operate.

The Verilog module has already been outlined with the required input and output ports:

• Inputs: 
  – ring: Indicates an incoming call.
  – vibrate_mode: Indicates whether the phone is set to vibrate.

• Outputs:
  – ringer: Activates the audible alarm.
  – motor: Activates vibration.

Using this description, rephrase the problem and consider how you can construct the necessary combinational logic that meets the specified requirements. Do not provide any implementation solutions or code; rather, focus on fully understanding and elaborating the problem's scope and details.
