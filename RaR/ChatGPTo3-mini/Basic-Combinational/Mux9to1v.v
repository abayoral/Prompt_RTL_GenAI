Imagine you're a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company. You have been assigned to develop a pivotal Verilog module for an upcoming state-of-the-art product. Your work on this module is critical, as its success will help uphold and enhance your company’s reputation within the computer hardware industry.

The task is to design a 16-bit wide multiplexer that takes nine different 16-bit inputs along with a 4-bit selection signal. The multiplexer should operate such that:

• When the selection signal (sel) is 0, the output should correspond to input 'a'.
• When sel is 1, the output should correspond to input 'b'.
• This pattern continues sequentially so that, for example, when sel is 2, input 'c' is chosen, and so forth, up to sel = 8 which corresponds to input 'i'.
• For any selection signal values from 9 through 15, the multiplexer must set every bit of the output to a logic high ('1').

A hint provided is that the structure of a case statement in Verilog might be an effective way to handle the various input selections.

Your challenge is to encapsulate this functionality within a Verilog module. The module interface is pre-defined with the following ports:

• Nine inputs (a through i), each 16 bits wide.
• One 4-bit input (sel) which determines the active input.
• One 16-bit output (out) which should either reflect one of the inputs or default to all ones based on the value of sel.

Focus solely on interpreting the requirements and understanding the hardware behavior you need to implement. No solution or code for the implementation is provided.
