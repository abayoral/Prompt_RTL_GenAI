Imagine you're a seasoned Digital Design Engineer tasked with creating a critical module in Verilog for a next-generation product. In this scenario, you need to develop a circuit that interprets the scancodes received from a PS/2 keyboard—specifically for a game application—to determine which arrow key has been pressed. The design objective is to monitor the most recent 16-bit scancode input and, based on its value, assert one of four outputs corresponding to the left, down, right, and up arrow keys.

The specific requirements are as follows:

• The module will have one 16-bit input (named scancode) and four single-bit outputs (named left, down, right, and up).

• The mapping from scancode to arrow key is predefined:
  – A scancode of 16'he06b should trigger the left arrow output.
  – A scancode of 16'he072 should trigger the down arrow output.
  – A scancode of 16'he074 should trigger the right arrow output.
  – A scancode of 16'he075 should trigger the up arrow output.
  – For any other scancode value, none of the arrow outputs should be asserted.

• The design must ensure that latches are not inadvertently created during synthesis. This means that every output must be explicitly assigned a value in every possible branch of the logic. A common strategy to achieve this is to initialize all outputs to a default value (typically 0) at the start of a combinational always block before using a case statement (or if-elseif conditions) to check for specific scancodes.

• Although the solution can involve a straightforward case statement with four specific cases (plus a default case), it is crucial that each of the four outputs (left, down, right, and up) is explicitly defined for every possible scenario, including within each branch of the statement. Simply providing a default case is not sufficient; the code must ensure that there is no pathway where an output remains unassigned.

• The design should adhere to the Verilog-2001 standard to ensure compatibility and smooth synthesis.

Your challenge is to design and implement the Verilog module that meets these specifications. The module should correctly decode the scancode input and assert the corresponding arrow key output, ensuring all signals are properly handled to avoid synthesis issues. Remember, the success of this module is vital for the reputation of your company in the hardware design industry.
