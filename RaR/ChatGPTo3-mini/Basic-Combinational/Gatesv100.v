Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and you’ve been assigned a vital task that will play a critical role in a next-generation product. Your assignment involves developing a Verilog module that manipulates a 100-bit input vector and produces three distinct output vectors based on specific relationships between each bit and its adjacent neighbour. The quality of your implementation is paramount, as it will have a direct impact on your company’s reputation in the computer hardware industry.

Here’s a detailed explanation of the requirements:

1. Input Vector (in[99:0]):
 • You are provided with a 100-bit vector named "in".
 • Each bit in this vector will be examined relative to one of its neighbors to generate the output results.

2. Output Vector: out_both (Size: 99 bits: out_both[98:0])
 • Purpose: Each bit in out_both should reflect whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'.
 • Explanation: For every bit position i in out_both (except the highest bit, out_both[99], which is not required), the module should check if in[i] and the bit immediately to its left (which, based on the provided example, is in[i+1]) are both '1'. For instance, out_both[98] should indicate whether in[98] and in[99] are '1'.
 • Note: Since in[99] does not have a left neighbour beyond the vector boundary, you do not need to compute or provide a value for out_both[99].

3. Output Vector: out_any (Size: 99 bits: out_any[99:1])
 • Purpose: Each bit in out_any should represent whether at least one bit is '1' in a pair consisting of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right.
 • Explanation: In practical terms, for a given bit position i in out_any, the design should evaluate if either in[i] or its immediate right neighbour in[i-1] is '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate whether either in[2] or in[1] is '1'.
 • Note: Because in[0] does not have a right neighbour, there is no need to generate a signal for out_any[0].

4. Output Vector: out_different (Size: 100 bits: out_different[99:0])
 • Purpose: Each bit in out_different should indicate whether the corresponding bit in "in" is different from its adjacent bit to the left.
 • Explanation: For each bit position i, the module should determine if in[i] is not equal to its neighbour to the left. To illustrate, out_different[98] should be '1' if in[98] differs from in[99].
 • Additional Requirement: Unlike the previous outputs, here the board is required to treat the input vector as if it “wraps around” at the ends. This means that for the highest index (in[99]), the neighbour to the left is considered as in[0].

Additional Hints:
 • The operation for all three output vectors can be efficiently achieved using only three assign statements leveraging Verilog’s vector operations.

Your task is to reformulate these specifications in your Verilog code for a module named "top_module" which has the following interface:

 module top_module( 
   input [99:0] in,
   output [98:0] out_both,
   output [99:1] out_any,
   output [99:0] out_different );
   // Module implementation goes here
 endmodule

Please elaborate the design such that every detail is clearly reflected in your code, adhering to the specifications provided without adding any extra functionality or altering the intended relationships between input bits and their neighbours. Do not provide any implementation or solution details here—only the clarified and expanded problem statement as described.
