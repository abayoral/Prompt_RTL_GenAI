Imagine you have been appointed as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prestigious hardware design company. Your current assignment involves designing a vital Verilog module that will play a crucial role in a next-generation product. This module is not just a part of the system—it is central to maintaining the reputation and performance standards of the company in the competitive computer hardware industry.

Your task is to create a combinational circuit that processes a 100-bit wide input vector, referred to as in[99:0]. The design should compute three specific outputs based on this input:

1. out_and: This output should represent the result of a Boolean AND operation applied across all 100 input bits simultaneously (equivalent to a 100-input AND gate).

2. out_or: Here, the result should be the output of a Boolean OR operation applied to all 100 input bits concurrently (serving the role of a 100-input OR gate).

3. out_xor: This output should be generated by applying a Boolean XOR operation across all 100 bits (equivalent to a 100-input XOR gate).

A helpful hint provided in the problem description is the use of Verilog's reduction operators. You are encouraged to utilize these operators to simplify the implementation of the combinational logic functions described above.

For clarity, you need to complete the following module skeleton in Verilog without providing any solution details:

---------------------------------------------------
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor 
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
---------------------------------------------------

Your goal is to clearly understand the requirements and develop a robust and efficient solution accordingly, while ensuring that the design meets the critical performance and reliability standards expected from a next-generation hardware product. Please note that no code solutions or hints regarding the implementation specifics should be provided—just a clear definition of the problem and the design objectives.
