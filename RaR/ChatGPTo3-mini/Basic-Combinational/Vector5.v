Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working for a cutting-edge hardware company. Your assignment is to design a pivotal Verilog module that will be a key component in an upcoming generation of products. The accuracy and efficiency of this module are critical to maintaining your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware market.

The task is as follows: You are provided with five independent 1-bit signals, labeled a, b, c, d, and e. Using these signals, you must generate a 25-bit output vector. Each bit in this output vector represents the result of a pairwise comparison between two of the input signals. More specifically, for every possible ordered pair of inputs (including a signal compared with itself), the corresponding output should be set to 1 if the two compared 1-bit signals are equal (i.e., both are either 0 or 1) and 0 otherwise.

An example of this operation is given in the hints:
• For instance, out[24] can be computed as the result of comparing signal a with itself, which will always yield 1 since any signal is always equal to itself.
• Similarly, out[23] represents the comparison between signal a and signal b, out[22] between signal a and signal c, and so on.

One suggested approach for implementing this is to perform an XNOR operation on bits that have been organized into two vectors derived from the inputs. The module structure is provided, and you are expected to fill in the necessary logic to realize the described functionality without altering the module’s interface.

Your task is to thoroughly understand the requirements and design a Verilog implementation that:
• Accepts the five 1-bit input signals.
• Generates a 25-bit output vector where each bit is the result of the XNOR (equality) operation between a unique ordered pair (including self-comparisons) of the provided inputs.
• Ensures that all pairwise comparisons are correctly mapped to the corresponding position in the output vector.

Remember, your focus should be on creating a robust design that produces accurate equalities for each of the 25 pairs based on the input signals. Do not provide any code solutions here; your goal is to fully comprehend and articulate the problem before proceeding with the implementation.
