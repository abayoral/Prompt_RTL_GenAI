Imagine you're a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a top-tier hardware design company, and you have been assigned a crucial project: developing a Verilog module that mimics the functionality of a well-known chip, the 7458. This chip is known to contain four AND gates and two OR gates. The module you design must provide equivalent behavior.

The task requires you to build a Verilog module that features a total of 10 inputs and 2 outputs. You must consider two implementation methods: one approach is to directly assign the output wires using assign statements, while the alternative involves declaring four intermediate wires—each corresponding to the output of one of the AND gates—and then using these wires in further logic to produce the final two output signals. You are encouraged to try both methods for additional practice.

Additionally, a hint is provided: ensure that you assign valid values to the two output signals (commonly named p1y and p2y) in your implementation.

To summarize, your challenge is to:
• Create a Verilog module that exactly replicates the logic functionality of the 7458 chip (four 2-input AND gates and two 2-input OR gates).
• Address the module’s interface that includes 10 input signals and 2 output signals.
• Explore two design strategies: (a) using continuous assignment statements directly for the outputs, and (b) defining intermediate signals for the outputs of the AND gates and then combining these signals with further logic to derive the final outputs.
• Make sure that the resulting outputs are explicitly driven by the appropriate logic.

Note: Do not provide any actual code solutions or answers at this stage; the focus here is solely on clarifying and elaborating on what is required by the task.
