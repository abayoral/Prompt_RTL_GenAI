Imagine you are serving as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, where you're assigned a mission-critical task for a next-generation product. The project requires you to develop a Verilog module, and its flawless operation is essential for upholding the esteemed reputation of your computer hardware company.

Your assignment is to design a Verilog module whose function is to perform a simple AND gate operation. The module will have two one-bit input signals (a and b) and one one-bit output signal (out). It is important to note that in Verilog, there exist both bitwise-AND (&) and logical-AND (&&) operators. However, given that you are dealing with single-bit signals, either operator will function correctly for this purpose.

In summary, you need to:
• Define a module named top_module that takes two one-bit inputs and produces a one-bit output.
• Implement the internal logic to compute the AND of the two inputs.
• Insert your solution within the structure provided for the module.
