Consider the following design challenge:

You are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company. Your responsibility is to develop a critical Verilog module that will serve as a key component in a next-generation product. The quality and correctness of your module are essential because they have a direct impact on the reputation and success of the company within the competitive computer hardware industry.

The specific task is to implement a digital logic circuit based on the details provided by a Karnaugh map. The Karnaugh map is structured with four horizontal rows, representing the combinations of c and d (c'd', c'd, cd, cd'), and four vertical columns, representing the combinations of a and b (a'b', a'b, ab, ab'). Each cell in the map contains either a 0 or a 1 according to the truth table below:

   a'b'   a'b   ab   ab'
c'd'   0      1     0     1
c'd    1      0     1     0
cd     0      1     0     1
cd'    1      0     1     0

Your challenge is to analyze this Karnaugh map and derive a simplified Boolean expression that accurately represents the described logic. You are encouraged to attempt both the product-of-sums (POS) and sum-of-products (SOP) simplification methods during this process.

Once you have your simplified Boolean representations, your next step is to translate the derived logic into a Verilog module. The skeleton of the module is provided below:

module top_module(
    input  a,
    input  b,
    input  c,
    input  d,
    output out
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule

Your task is to fill in the "Insert your code here" section with a Verilog implementation that reflects the simplified Boolean expressions that you have derived from the Karnaugh map. It is important that your implementation is logically equivalent to the simplified expressions you obtain from analyzing the map.

Remember, the goal of this exercise is not only to reach the correct system behavior but also to demonstrate your ability to simplify complex logic expressions using standard techniques and then accurately translate them into code. The final verification cannot check if you have the absolute optimal simplification, but it will verify if the reduced expression is equivalent and correctly implemented as a circuit in Verilog.

Please ensure that your answer focuses solely on clarifying and elaborating on the problem requirements, without providing any explicit solutions or code implementations.
