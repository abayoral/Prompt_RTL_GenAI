Imagine you are working as a senior Digital Design Engineer within a top-tier hardware development company. Your latest project involves the design of a critical Verilog module that plays a key role in the next-generation product line. The performance of this module is essential to uphold the high reputation of your company in the competitive hardware market.

The task at hand is to design a digital circuit that performs sign extension on an 8-bit binary number, transforming it into a 32-bit representation. Specifically, you need to create a module that takes an 8-bit input and outputs a 32-bit number where the most significant 24 bits are generated by replicating the original input's sign bit (the eighth bit) 24 times. This replication process ensures that the sign (positive or negative) is preserved when the smaller bit-size number is extended to a larger bit-width.

In summary, your responsibilities include:
1. Writing a Verilog module that accepts an 8-bit input vector.
2. Producing a 32-bit output where the highest 24 bits are copies of bit 7 (the sign bit) of the input.
3. Appending the original 8-bit input to these 24 replicated bits.

Note that this approach, often called sign extension, is commonly used in digital design to maintain the signed interpretation of numbers when increasing bit width. The module should follow a structure similar to the provided template, where you are expected to modify the placeholder code so that the output correctly reflects the sign-extended input.

Remember, this task is strictly about clarifying, rephrasing, and expanding upon the problem statement; you should not provide any solution or answer implementations as part of your initial response.
