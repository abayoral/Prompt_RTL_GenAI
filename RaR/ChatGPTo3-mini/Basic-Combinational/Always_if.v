Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, and you have been assigned a mission-critical task for developing a Verilog module that is a crucial component of an upcoming next-generation product. This module's flawless performance is essential for upholding your company's prestigious reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

In this assignment, you are required to design a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux) that selects between two input signals, a and b, based on the values of two selection signals, sel_b1 and sel_b2. The selection logic must be implemented such that the multiplexer outputs b only when both sel_b1 and sel_b2 are asserted (i.e., both are true). In every other scenario, the multiplexer should output a.

To fully demonstrate your expertise, you must implement this behavior using two different coding techniques within the same module:
1. Use continuous assignment statements (assign statements) to define the multiplexer behavior.
2. Use a procedural block (an always block with an if statement) to achieve the identical selection logic.

The Verilog code should adhere to the verilog_2001 standard as indicated by the synthesis directive. Below is the module declaration you will use to integrate your code:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input sel_b1,
    input sel_b2,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always
);
    // Your code implementation goes here
endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Your job is to insert the code inside this framework that meets the specified requirements while ensuring that both implementation approaches are logically consistent and syntactically correct according to the specified Verilog standard. Please note: No solutions or coding answers should be provided; the focus here is on understanding and elaborating on the assignment details.
