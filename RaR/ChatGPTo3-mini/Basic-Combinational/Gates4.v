Imagine you are a senior digital design engineer working at a premier hardware design company. You have been assigned a crucial project that involves developing a Verilog module for a next-generation product. The successful creation of this module is vital for your company's reputation in the competitive computer hardware market.

Your task is to design a combinational circuit module that meets the following specifications:

• It must have four input signals grouped as in[3:0].

• It must produce three distinct output signals:
  1. out_and: This output should reflect the logical AND operation applied to all four input signals.
  2. out_or: This output should reflect the logical OR operation applied to all four input signals.
  3. out_xor: This output should reflect the logical XOR operation applied to all four input signals.

You need to implement these functionalities within a Verilog module named top_module. The structure of the module is provided as a template, and you are expected to insert the necessary Verilog code to realize the combinational logic.

Your goal is to ensure that the module correctly computes the 4-input AND, OR, and XOR operations on the provided input vector and assigns the result to the corresponding output signals. No additional functionality is required—focus solely on accurately implementing these three separate logic operations within the specified module framework.
