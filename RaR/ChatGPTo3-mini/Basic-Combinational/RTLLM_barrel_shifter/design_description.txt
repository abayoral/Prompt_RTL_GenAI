The challenge involves creating an efficient Verilog module that functions as an 8-bit barrel shifter. Your goal is to design a module named "barrel_shifter" that performs a bit rotation or shifting operation on an 8-bit input. The number of positions by which the input should be shifted is determined by a 3-bit control signal.

Here are the detailed specifications and requirements for the module:

1. Module Functionality:
   • The module must accept an 8-bit input and use a corresponding 3-bit control signal to determine how many positions the bits should be shifted or rotated.
   • Each bit of the control signal independently indicates a specific shift magnitude: the least significant bit (ctrl[0]) controls a shift by 1 bit, the next bit (ctrl[1]) dictates a shift by 2 bits, and the most significant bit (ctrl[2]) indicates a shift by 4 bits.

2. Interface Details:
   • Input Ports:
     - "in [7:0]": This is the primary data input that holds the 8-bit value to be manipulated.
     - "ctrl [2:0]": This control signal determines the variable shift amounts for the barrel shifter.
   • Output Port:
     - "out [7:0]": This port should output the modified 8-bit value after the specified shifts have been applied.

3. Implementation Considerations:
   • The implementation will be structured in stages, with each stage corresponding to a separate shift based on the individual bits within the control signal.
   • Within each stage, you will employ 2-to-1 multiplexers (mux2X1) to decide whether to pass the original or a shifted version of the input to the next stage, based on the state (asserted or deasserted) of the current control bit.
   • The shifting operations should be conducted in layers:
     - Start with evaluating ctrl[2] to determine if the input should be shifted by 4 positions.
     - Follow this with a shift by 2 positions if ctrl[1] is active.
     - Lastly, consider a 1-bit shift if ctrl[0] is asserted.
   • The mux2X1 components are critical in creating the dynamic behavior of the shifter, as they provide the decision-making logic necessary for output selection at each stage.

4. Task Objective:
   • Your assignment is to write the complete Verilog code for this module. The code should encapsulate all the functional behavior described above, including proper use of multiplexers and shifting logic.
   • The design must ensure that the barrel shifter dynamically and correctly rotates or shifts the 8-bit input based on the 3-bit control signal.

Please craft a detailed, well-structured Verilog implementation of the "barrel_shifter" module that adheres to these specifications. The code should reflect clarity in design and a systematic approach in handling the staged shifting process with appropriate multiplexing logic. Remember, the focus is on the proper integration of layers and control-based decision-making to produce the intended bit rotation effect.
