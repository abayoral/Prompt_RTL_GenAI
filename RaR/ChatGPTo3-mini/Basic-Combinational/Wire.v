Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working at an industry-leading hardware design company. Your task is to design a fundamental Verilog module that is critical for a next-generation product. The reliability and performance of this module are key to preserving your company’s reputation in the competitive hardware market.

The assignment is to build a simple module named "top_module" with the following characteristics:

• It accepts a single input signal and produces a single output signal.
• The module’s functionality should mimic that of a wire, meaning the output should directly reflect the input with no modifications.

You are expected to clearly define the module structure in Verilog with these specifications. Remember, no additional logic processing is required—the design should maintain a straightforward, wire-like behavior from input to output.
