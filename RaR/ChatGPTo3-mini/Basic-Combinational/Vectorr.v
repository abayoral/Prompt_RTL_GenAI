Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working for a prestigious hardware design company, and you're responsible for developing an essential Verilog module for an upcoming generation of hardware products. The module you create has a significant impact on preserving your organization's reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

The task at hand is as follows:

You are provided with an 8-bit input vector (in[7:0]). Your objective is to create a Verilog module that takes this input and produces an 8-bit output vector (out[7:0]), where the order of the bits is completely reversed. In other words, the bit that was originally at the least significant position in the input should become the most significant bit in the output, the second least significant should become second most significant, and so on.

A helpful hint to keep in mind is that a simple assignment like assign out[7:0] = in[0:7]; will not achieve the desired result because Verilog does not support flipping the bit order through vector slicing in that manner. You may find that taking advantage of the concatenation operator can simplify your code by enabling you to perform the entire bit reversal using just one assign statement instead of writing eight separate assignments.

Below is the basic module declaration:

-------------------------------------------------
module top_module( 
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] out
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------

Your challenge is to fill in the module so that it produces the correctly reversed bit sequence on out, strictly adhering to the constraints regarding bit ordering manipulation.
