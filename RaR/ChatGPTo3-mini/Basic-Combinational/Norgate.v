Imagine you are a highly experienced Digital Design Engineer at a premier hardware design company. Your current assignment involves developing a crucial Verilog module that will form a vital component in a next-generation product. The performance and reliability of this module are essential for upholding our company’s renowned reputation within the computer hardware industry.

Your task is to create a Verilog module that performs the function of a NOR gate. For clarity, remember that a NOR gate is essentially an OR gate with its output inverted; it only produces a high output (logic 1) when all inputs are low (logic 0). The design of this module should be concise, and it is important to note that implementing a NOR function in Verilog requires using two operators.

Please consider the following when developing your module:
• The code should incorporate two specific operators to correctly implement the NOR function.
• Recall that Verilog distinguishes between bitwise-OR (|) and logical-OR (||) operators, much like the C language. However, since the NOR gate in this scenario operates on one-bit signals, either operator may be used as they yield equivalent results.
• The code should be structured within the provided module template:
  - The module begins with defined inputs ‘a’ and ‘b’.
  - The output is labeled as ‘out’.
  - You need to insert your implementation code where indicated by the comment “// Insert your code here.”

Your objective is to draft a clear and correct Verilog module that faithfully implements the NOR gate's logical functionality, remaining within the constraints and hints provided. Do not include any code solutions or additional answers—focus solely on understanding and elaborating on the question requirements as described.
