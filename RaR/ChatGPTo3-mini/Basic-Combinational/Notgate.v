Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and you have been assigned a crucial task. Your reputation—and that of your company—rests on the development of a reliable and efficient Verilog module that will play a key role in the next-generation product. The module you need to design must implement a simple NOT gate operation.

Your challenge is to write a Verilog module named "top_module" that accepts a single one-bit input and produces a single one-bit output, which is the logical inversion of the input. Please note that within Verilog there exists a distinction between the bitwise-NOT operator (~) and the logical-NOT operator (!), similar to what is found in the C programming language. However, for this particular one-bit operation, either operator can be used effectively.

The module should follow the basic structure provided below:

module top_module( input in, output out );

// Insert your code here

endmodule

Your task is to enhance this template by inserting the appropriate Verilog code that will accomplish the inversion of the input signal. This module will later be integrated into a larger system, making its accuracy and reliability imperative. Keep in mind the importance of code clarity and hardware design principles as you complete your implementation.
