Below is an expanded and rephrased version of the original inquiry:

I am looking for guidance in designing a Verilog module, named freq_divbyfrac, that implements a frequency divider capable of dividing an input clock signal by a non-integer (fractional) factor. More specifically, the project requires the clock frequency to be reduced by a factor of 3.5. This fractional division will be realized using a double-edge clocking technique to handle the half-integer division requirement. It is important to consider and address any potential imbalances in the duty cycle that might arise as a consequence of using unequal division ratios.

The core idea is to manage the division of the clock cycles in a non-uniform manner and to apply phase-shifting techniques to generate a fractional output clock signal with a reasonably smooth waveform. The approach involves generating an intermediate clock signal by dividing the clock cycles unevenly and then creating two phase-adjusted versions. In this specific example, the division will be based on counting a total of 7 source clock periods (which is the multiplied factor, here referred to by MUL2_DIV_CLK = 7). Within these 7 cycles, one part will consist of 4 cycles, and the other will consist of 3 cycles. Then, a phase shift is implemented on these clock segments: one phase version is delayed by half a clock period, while the other is advanced by half a clock period. Finally, both phase-adjusted signals are combined (using a logical OR operation) to yield the final output clock that maintains a uniform period despite the fractional division.

The module should include the following ports:

• Input Ports:
 – clk: The primary clock signal that is to be divided.
 – rst_n: An active-low reset signal to initialize or reset the module's state.

• Output Port:
 – clk_div: The output clock signal that results from the fractional division of the input clock.

The design should use a counter that cycles through the defined 7 clock periods in order to accomplish the 3.5x division. The counter helps create two distinct phases, one corresponding to 4 clock cycles and the other to 3 clock cycles, which then undergo phase-shifting (one by delaying and the other by advancing half a clock period). The two modified signals are combined to produce an evenly spaced output clock signal.

Could you provide a detailed Verilog code implementation that meets the above specifications and thoroughly addresses the requirements for dividing the clock by a fractional factor using double-edge clocking and phase-shift adjustment techniques? Please note that I am only looking for the explanation of the requirements here, without any actual solution or code at this time.
