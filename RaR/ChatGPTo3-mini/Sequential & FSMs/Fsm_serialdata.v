Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a top-tier hardware company on an essential project for a next-generation product. Your task is to develop a Verilog module that plays a critical role in the product's functionality and overall reliability. 

The module you need to design must incorporate a finite state machine (FSM) that processes a continuous stream of serial data. This FSM is responsible for detecting the following sequence:

1. A start bit indicating the beginning of a new byte.
2. Following the start bit, it must correctly receive eight sequential data bits.
3. A stop bit must then be identified to validate the transmission.

Importantly, if the expected stop bit is not immediately encountered when anticipated, the FSM must continue monitoring the stream and wait until a stop bit is found before it proceeds to process the next byte of data.

In addition to the FSM, your design must include a datapath component. This datapath is responsible for gathering the bits from the serial stream and assembling them into a complete 8-bit byte. Remember that the serial protocol transmits data with the least significant bit (LSB) first, so your design should accommodate this order. Once a valid byte has been fully received and assembled, the output (designated as out_byte) should reflect this 8-bit value, and a signal named done should be set to high (or valid) to indicate that the data byte is ready for use. When done is not set, the value of out_byte is considered irrelevant or don't-care.

To summarize, your assignment is to integrate the existing FSM (which identifies the valid start bit, data bits, and stop bit) with a new datapath that shifts in the serial bits one at a time and organizes them into a correctly aligned parallel byte output. You are to ensure that the out_byte is valid only when the done signal is asserted, following the specified serial communication protocol.

Your Verilog module, named "top_module", should include the following ports:

- clk: The clock input for synchronous operations.
- in: The input serial bit.
- reset: A synchronous reset signal.
- out_byte: An 8-bit output representing the correctly received data byte.
- done: A flag indicating that a complete and valid data byte has been received.

This task requires careful attention to the FSM behavior and datapath integration, ensuring robust handling of serial communication errors, such as missing stop bits, before moving onto the next byte.
