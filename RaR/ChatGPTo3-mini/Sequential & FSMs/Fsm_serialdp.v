Imagine you are a lead Digital Design Engineer at a top-tier hardware company, and you have been assigned a crucial task: enhancing a Verilog module for a next-generation product. This module is critical, as its proper functioning upholds your organization's reputation in the competitive computer hardware market.

Your current project involves improving a serial receiver. The receiver, which was previously designed to interpret serial data, must now include an odd parity checking mechanism. Essentially, after each 8-bit data byte, an additional parity bit is transmitted. With odd parity, the total count of 1s in the full 9-bit sequence (8 data bits plus the parity bit) must be an odd number. For instance, the bit sequence "101001011" is valid since it contains five 1s, whereas "001001011" fails the test.

To accommodate this new requirement, you need to modify both the finite state machine (FSM) and the datapath in the receiver. Your FSM must detect the start bit, sequentially acquire all 9 bits (8 data bits and the parity bit), and then verify that the calculated parity meets the odd parity condition. Only when both the parity check is successful and the stop bit is correctly received should the module assert a "done" signal, indicating successful reception of a byte.

One crucial aspect is handling protocol errors: if the expected stop bit is not received, the FSM should persistently wait until a stop bit appears before it attempts to process the next byte. This behavior ensures that any transmission errors are gracefully handled and do not disrupt the reception of subsequent bytes.

To aid you in this task, you are provided with a Verilog module for parity calculationâ€”a Toggle Flip-Flop (TFF) implementation. This module takes a streaming bit input and resets appropriately to count the number of 1 bits for each received byte before the check is performed.

Your assignment is to integrate this parity-checking feature into your serial receiver design by reworking the existing FSM and datapath. In your final Verilog module, you will need to:
1. Detect the start bit.
2. Correctly sample 9 bits (accounting for the 8-bit data and an extra parity bit).
3. Calculate the parity using the provided parity module.
4. Validate the received byte by ensuring the odd parity requirement is met.
5. Monitor for the stop bit, and only assert the "done" output signal when everything checks out.
6. In the case of a missing stop bit, implement a waiting mechanism until a proper stop bit is detected before starting the next reception.

The focus is on ensuring the integrity of each received byte with robust error handling, thereby enhancing the reliability of the communication system in your product.
