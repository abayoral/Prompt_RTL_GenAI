Imagine you're a lead Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company. Your current assignment is to create a Verilog module that is integral to the next-generation product line. This module must be meticulously designed since its reliability is crucial for sustaining your company's industry reputation.

The task involves the implementation of eight D flip-flops (DFFs) with several specific requirements:

1. Each flip-flop must respond to a synchronous reset that is active high. However, rather than resetting the output to the traditional value of zero, these flip-flops should initialize to a specific hexadecimal value: 0x34.

2. All of the D flip-flops should be designed to trigger on the negative (falling) edge of the clock signal (clk). Make sure that the timing and edge selection is clearly implemented in accordance with the design specification.

3. The module should be structured within a Verilog design framework, with defined inputs and outputs. Key signals include the clock (clk), a reset signal, an 8-bit input (d), and an 8-bit output (q).

4. There is a hint provided for consideration: resetting a register to '1' is sometimes referred to as "preset" in digital design terminology, which might be relevant for your understanding and implementation of the reset behavior.

Your goal is to write the Verilog module named "top_module" meeting the above specifications. It should encapsulate the behavior of the eight D flip-flops, ensuring that upon activation of the reset, each flip-flop will set its value to 0x34, and that they all reliably sample the input (d) on the negative edge of the clock.

Remember, the emphasis is on strictly adhering to these design constraints without deviating from the required behavior. No code solution is provided here; the focus is entirely on ensuring that the question is clearly understood and expanded upon, setting the stage for your own implementation.
