Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company, where you are responsible for developing a crucial Verilog module for a next-generation hardware product. The performance and accuracy of this module are vital, as they will have a significant impact on preserving your company’s reputation in the highly competitive computer hardware industry.

Your challenge involves designing a finite state machine (FSM) intended to control a motor. This FSM interacts with its environment through several signals:

• Inputs:
  – x and y: These signals are provided by the motor itself.
  – clk: A clock signal used to synchronize FSM operations.
  – resetn: An active-low synchronous reset signal. While asserted (i.e., held low), the FSM must remain in a designated starting state (state A).

• Outputs:
  – f and g: These act as control signals for the motor.

The behavior of the FSM must adhere to the following sequence:

1. Startup and Reset Behavior:
  – When the resetn input is asserted (i.e., low), the FSM should immobilize in a starting state (state A).
  – Once the reset signal is de-asserted (i.e., goes high), the FSM should, on the first clock edge after de-assertion, set the output f high (f = 1) for exactly one clock cycle.

2. Monitoring and Processing the x Input:
  – Only after the clock cycle in which f is set high should the FSM start observing the x input.
  – The FSM must monitor the x input until it detects a precise sequence of values: on three consecutive clock cycles, x must produce the sequence 1, followed by 0, and then 1.
  – Once this specific sequence (1, 0, 1) is detected, on the following clock cycle, the FSM should assert the output g by setting it high (g = 1).

3. Monitoring and Processing the y Input:
  – After setting g high, the FSM must continue to monitor the y input while keeping g high.
  – There is a critical timing constraint imposed on y:
    a. If the input y transitions to a value of 1 within a maximum of two clock cycles, the FSM must permanently maintain g = 1 (i.e., g remains high until a reset occurs).
    b. Conversely, if y does not reach a value of 1 within these two clock cycles, then on the appropriate subsequent clock cycle, g must be permanently set to 0 (i.e., it remains low until reset is reasserted).

The FSM design should be implemented in Verilog, encapsulated within a module defined as follows:

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input resetn,    // active-low synchronous reset
    input x,
    input y,
    output f,
    output g
);

  // Your implementation code will be inserted here.

endmodule

Key additional note:
  – It’s important to remember that monitoring of the x input should only commence in the clock cycle immediately following the cycle in which f was set to 1.

Your assignment is to implement this FSM based on the specifications above. The design must adhere strictly to the timing and sequence requirements, ensuring that both outputs, f and g, are generated correctly in response to the inputs and reset condition. Focus on clearly defining the states, transitions, and control logic within your Verilog module to accurately realize the desired motor control behavior.
