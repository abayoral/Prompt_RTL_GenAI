Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a top-notch hardware design company, and you have been assigned a high-priority task. Your company’s reputation in the computer hardware industry depends on the success of a new, cutting-edge product feature. This feature involves a key Verilog module that must be flawless in its implementation.

Your specific assignment is to design and implement a D flip-flop within a Verilog module. The provided template for the module is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input in, 
    output out
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------------

In this context, your goal is to fill in the code area so that the module behaves exactly as a D flip-flop should—it should capture the input 'in' on a clock edge and then output this value as 'out'. Your solution must be optimized for synthesis and adhere to standard digital design practices.

Key elements to consider in your design:
• Clarity in how the clock (clk) signal is used to control when data from the input (in) is sampled.
• Ensuring that the timing requirements of a D flip-flop are met for correct and reliable operation.
• Integration of your code into the broader design while maintaining consistency with industry practices.

While you work on this task, remember that the precision and reliability of your implementation will have a significant impact on the overall performance of the next-generation product. No solution or code implementation is provided here—your objective is to formulate the correct Verilog code to complete the described module.
