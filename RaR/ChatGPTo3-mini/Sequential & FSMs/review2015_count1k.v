Imagine you're a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company. Your current assignment is to develop a critical Verilog module destined for use in a next-generation product. The reputation of your company in the competitive hardware market depends on the reliability and efficiency of this module.

The task is to design a counter that operates as follows:

• The counter should have a range from 0 to 999. This means it will count sequentially starting at 0 and ending at 999, then restart from 0, thereby creating a cycle of 1000 clock cycles.

• The counting process should be synchronized with a clock input (clk). Every rising edge, for instance, might trigger the counting process according to the design specifications.

• The counter must incorporate a synchronous reset mechanism. When the reset signal is active, the counter should immediately set its value to 0 (on the appropriate clock edge), regardless of its current state.

• The design should expose a 10-bit output (since 999 requires 10 bits to be properly represented) which represents the current count.

Your Verilog module should follow the provided module header structure, where you have an input for the clock, an input for the reset, and a 10-bit output representing the counter’s value.

Keeping these requirements in mind, develop an elaborated description of how you would implement this counter module. Do not provide an actual implementation or solution code; rather, focus on clarifying and expanding upon the requirements and design considerations of the task.
