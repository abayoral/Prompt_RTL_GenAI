Consider the following design challenge that you need to address as an expert in Verilog. Your assignment is to develop a digital module—specifically, an 8-bit multiplier—that implements the multiplication operation using the shift-and-add method. This technique, known for its simplicity and natural alignment with digital circuit design, involves conditionally adding a shifted version of the multiplicand based on the individual bits of the multiplier.

Below is a detailed description of the specifications and expectations for your module:

Module Specifications:
• Name: multi_8bit
  - This is the designated name for the Verilog module you will create.

Input Ports:
1. A [7:0]:
   - An 8-bit vector representing the multiplicand. This is one of the two numbers to be multiplied. The multiplication process will involve shifting and adding this operand based on the bits of the other operand.
2. B [7:0]:
   - Another 8-bit vector that serves as the multiplier. Every bit in this operand will determine whether the multiplicand should contribute to the final result. Specifically, if a bit is set to 1, the multiplicand (appropriately shifted) will be added to the running total.

Output Port:
• product [15:0]:
   - A 16-bit vector which will provide the final result of the multiplication. The width of 16 bits is chosen to fully accommodate the range of values resulting from multiplying two 8-bit numbers (ranging from 0 to 65,535), hence preventing any overflow.

Implementation Guidelines:
1. Shift-and-Add Multiplication Strategy:
   - You will implement the multiplication by scrutinizing each bit of the multiplier B. For every bit that is high (i.e., has a value of 1), your design should add the multiplicand A, appropriately shifted to reflect the positional significance of that bit, to an accumulating product. This process is analogous to how multiplication is performed manually in binary arithmetic.
   
2. Shifting Operation:
   - The procedure requires that after each conditional addition (or during the iterative process), the multiplicand A is shifted left. This left shift is essential as it aligns the multiplicand with the next bit in the multiplier. Essentially, each shift represents moving to the next higher order bit, which adjusts the value of the multiplicand accordingly for the weighted contribution.

3. Iterative Bit Analysis and Control Logic:
   - Your design should include control logic to iterate through all 8 bits of the multiplier B. This may involve the use of a loop or sequential logic to inspect each bit in turn, decide whether to perform the addition, and manage the corresponding left shift. Additionally, if a clocked (sequential) process is used for implementing this logic, ensure that the clocking mechanism correctly synchronizes the operations.

Task Summary:
Your task is to code this logic in Verilog, ensuring that the module conforms to the specifications detailed above. You should focus on accurately representing the iterative shift-and-add multiplication technique, handling both inputs and outputs appropriately, and considering any necessary clock process for sequential operations as might be required by your design. Remember to adhere strictly to the specification details provided and translate them into syntactically correct Verilog code without deviating from the described operational behavior.

Your final submission should be a Verilog module that encapsulates this functionality, ensuring that functionality, clarity, and proper hardware description practices are maintained throughout the implementation.
