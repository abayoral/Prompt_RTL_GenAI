Below is an expanded and rephrased version of the original question without including any implementation details or solutions:

Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm. Your next assignment is to create a critical Verilog module that will play a central role in a next-generation product. This module’s performance is crucial, as it directly impacts the reputation of your company's computer hardware in the marketplace.

Your task is to implement a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The design must follow these specific parameters:

1. The LFSR should be 32 bits wide.
2. The feedback taps should be defined at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1.
3. A synchronous, active-high reset signal is provided (reset), which must initialize the register to the value 32'h1.
4. The design should be implemented using vectors (rather than instantiating 32 individual D flip-flops) to ensure an efficient and manageable solution.

The provided module template includes a clock input, a reset input, and a 32-bit output. Make sure that your design conforms to these requirements and is suitable for integration into a high-performance hardware system.

Reframe the task in your own work, clarifying the design criteria and constraints. Remember, you are not required to include any sample code or detailed Verilog implementations—only restate and elaborate the problem as needed.
