Below is a more detailed and elaborated version of the original question:

You are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a top hardware design company, and you have been assigned an important task: design and implement a Verilog module that will serve as a critical component in your company’s next-generation computer hardware. The correct and efficient operation of this module is crucial to the company’s reputation in the industry.

Your assignment is to create a finite state machine (FSM) using a Mealy architecture. The specific requirements for the FSM are as follows:

1. The FSM must monitor an input signal, referred to as "x", and detect the occurrence of the binary sequence "101".
2. When the sequence "101" is recognized, the FSM should immediately assert an output signal named "z" by setting it to logic-1. This means that whenever the required sequence appears, "z" must reflect this detection as soon as possible according to Mealy machine timing.
3. The design must incorporate an asynchronous reset signal, labeled "aresetn", which is active-low. This reset should immediately bring the FSM to a known, stable state regardless of the clock, ensuring proper initialization or recovery.
4. A strict design constraint is imposed: you may only utilize three states in your state machine. Despite this limitation, the FSM must still be capable of correctly identifying overlapping instances of the "101" sequence. In other words, the FSM should correctly recognize a new sequence "101" even if part of it overlaps with a previously recognized sequence.

The skeleton of the Verilog module is provided below, and your task is to complete the module by implementing the required FSM logic that meets the above specifications:

------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input aresetn,    // Asynchronous active-low reset
    input x,
    output z
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

Please note that your work should focus solely on designing the described FSM. Ensure that your module adheres to all the constraints outlined, including the limited state count and the proper handling of the asynchronous active-low reset. Also, remember that the FSM must correctly handle overlapping sequences of "101" on the input "x".
