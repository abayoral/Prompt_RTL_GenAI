Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a top-tier hardware design company, and you have been assigned to develop a vital Verilog module that will be a core component in a next-generation product. The successful development of this module is crucial to preserving your computer hardware companyâ€™s esteemed reputation in the industry.

Your task is to design a top-level Verilog module that incorporates eight D flip-flops. Each of the D flip-flops must have an active high synchronous reset feature, meaning that the reset signal will only affect the flip-flop outputs when it is high and synchronized with the positive edge of the clock. The module should ensure that all operations are triggered by the rising (positive) edge of the clock signal.

The module has the following interface:

- clk: The clock input signal.
- reset: The synchronous reset input, which is active high.
- d: An 8-bit wide input vector that feeds into the eight flip-flops.
- q: An 8-bit wide output vector that represents the outputs of the eight flip-flops.

The primary objective is to implement these 8 flip-flops such that on every positive edge of the clk signal, each flip-flop captures its corresponding bit from the input d, unless the reset is asserted (high) at that very moment, in which case a defined reset behavior should occur.  

Please focus exclusively on clarifying this problem statement and ensuring that every requirement is clearly described, without providing any code implementation or solution hints.
