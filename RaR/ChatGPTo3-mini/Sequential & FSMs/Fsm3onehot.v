Imagine you are a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and you have just been assigned a key task that will affect the future of your organization's next-generation product. The challenge involves developing a Verilog module that implements a Moore state machine. This state machine has a single input (named "in") and a single output (named "out"), and it operates with four distinct states. The success of this module is extremely important because it directly influences the reputation of your company within the computer hardware industry.

The state machine is defined by the following state transition table. In this design, the states are encoded using a one-hot scheme where only one bit is set for each state. The specific one-hot encoding is as follows:  
 • State A is represented by 4'b0001  
 • State B is represented by 4'b0010  
 • State C is represented by 4'b0100  
 • State D is represented by 4'b1000  

Below is the transition table that defines both the next state and output based on the current state and input value:

  Current State   Input Value   Next State   Output  
   A       in = 0    →   A       0  
   A       in = 1    →   B       0  
   B       in = 0    →   C       0  
   B       in = 1    →   B       0  
   C       in = 0    →   A       0  
   C       in = 1    →   D       0  
   D       in = 0    →   C       1  
   D       in = 1    →   B       1  

Your assignment is to derive, solely by inspection, the logical equations that define the output and the state transitions (the combinational part of the logic) for this state machine using the provided one-hot encoding. Please pay attention to the following details while working on your design:

1. You need to focus only on the state transition and output logic portions of the design.
2. The hint provided suggests that you analyze the “in-edges” of the state transition diagram; that is, determine the conditions under which each state is reached based on the incoming transitions.
3. It is important to note that the testbench for this module will also supply inputs that aren’t strictly one-hot, so your implementation must be robust enough to handle such cases without using overly complex logic.

The framework of your Verilog module is provided below. Your task is to fill in the missing lines by encoding the logic equations for both state transitions and output generation. Be sure to replace the placeholder “...” with your finalized logic expressions:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input in,
    input [3:0] state,
    output [3:0] next_state,
    output out
);

    parameter A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3;

    // Insert your code below

    // State transition logic: Derive an equation for each state flip-flop.
    assign next_state[A] = ...;
    assign next_state[B] = ...;
    assign next_state[C] = ...;
    assign next_state[D] = ...;

    // Output logic: 
    assign out = ...;

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Please carefully analyze the state transition table and derive your logic equations accordingly. Remember, no partial or complete solutions should be provided at this stage—focus solely on clarifying the requirements and elaborating the task details for a clear understanding of what needs to be implemented.
