Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a premier hardware company, and you have been assigned a critical task: designing a Verilog module for a state-of-the-art product. The module you develop is essential not only for the product's functionality but also for upholding the company's prestigious reputation in the computer hardware industry.

Your objective is to design and implement a 4-bit binary counter. The counter should sequentially count from 0 through 15, covering exactly 16 distinct states. Once it reaches the maximum count of 15, the counter should loop back to 0, maintaining a consistent period of 16 clock cycles. An important aspect of this design is the incorporation of a synchronous reset. When the reset input is active (and it is active-high), the counter must immediately revert to 0, regardless of its current state, on the next clock cycle.

For this task, you are provided with a Verilog module template that includes inputs for the clock and reset signals, as well as a 4-bit output that represents the current count. Your challenge is to fill in this module with the appropriate Verilog code to accurately implement the 4-bit counting functionality as described.

Key points to consider and address in your design:
1. The counter must count in binary from 0 to 15 and then repeat, delivering a precise 16-cycle period.
2. The reset signal is synchronous and active-high, meaning it should only affect the counter during a clock edge and only when asserted.
3. The integrity and performance of the module are critical for the overall product, emphasizing the need for a robust and efficient implementation.

Your task is to elaborate the design details within the given module framework without providing any specific code or solutions.
