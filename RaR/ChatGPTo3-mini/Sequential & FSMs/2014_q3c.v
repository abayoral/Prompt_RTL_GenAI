Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working for a premier hardware design company, where the development of this particular Verilog module is crucial for the success of a next-generation product. Your task is to design a key portion of a digital system that directly impacts the company's industry reputation.

The challenge involves creating a Verilog module based on the following state-assignment table. This table specifies the present state (denoted by a three-bit vector y[2:0]), the corresponding next state (also represented as a three-bit vector Y[2:0]) under two conditions (when input x equals 0 and when x equals 1), and an associated output z for each state.

The state table is defined as follows:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Present State (y[2:0])     |   Next State (Y[2:0])             | Output z
                          |    (when x = 0)    (when x = 1)     
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
         000               |       000         001             |    0
         001               |       001         100             |    0
         010               |       010         001             |    0
         011               |       001         010             |    1
         100               |       011         100             |    1
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Your assignment is to implement the logic functions for the output derived from this table. Specifically, you need to develop the logic for:
1. The output Y0, which corresponds to the least significant bit (LSB) of the next state.
2. The output z, as indicated in the state table.

The module interface, which includes the clock signal (clk), current state (y[2:0]), input signal (x), and outputs (Y0 and z), is provided as part of the module skeleton below:

------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [2:0] y,
    input x,
    output Y0,
    output z
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
------------------------------------------------------------

Your goal is to create logic within this module that accurately reflects the state transitions and associated outputs as described by the table. The design must ensure that for every present state and condition applied through input x, the computation of Y0 and z strictly follows the mapping provided.

Keep in mind that you should only focus on clarifying and elaborating the question details. No solutions, code implementations, or specific answers are required at this stage; your objective is solely to ensure that the problem is understood clearly in terms of its requirements and context.
