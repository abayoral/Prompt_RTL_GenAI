Imagine you're the lead Digital Design Engineer at a top-tier hardware design firm, and you're tasked with creating a critical Verilog module for an upcoming cutting‐edge product. The reputation of your company in the competitive computer hardware industry heavily depends on the flawless performance of this module.

Your assignment is to design a Verilog module that processes an 8-bit input vector. For each bit in this vector, your module must monitor and detect changes in its state from one clock cycle to the next. Specifically, the module should identify any transitions that occur, but it must trigger an output only in the case of a rising edge—that is, when the input changes from 0 to 1.

The requirements are as follows:

• The module receives a clock signal (clk) and an 8-bit input vector (in).
• For every bit in the input vector, the design must compare the current state with the state from the previous clock cycle to detect any changes.
• When an individual bit exhibits a rising edge (transitions from 0 to 1), the corresponding bit in the output vector (anyedge) should be set on the following clock cycle.
• The design should clearly handle the synchronization, ensuring the output accurately reflects the one-cycle-delayed rising edge detection for each bit.

You should focus on developing an efficient and robust method suitable for integration into a high-performance product. The key challenge is setting up the appropriate registers or logic to track each bit’s previous value and generate the correct output signal at the precise time, maintaining bitwise consistency across the vector.
