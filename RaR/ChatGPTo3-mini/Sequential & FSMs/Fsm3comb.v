Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a premier hardware design company, and you have been assigned the responsibility of developing a crucial Verilog module for an upcoming, next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is essential for upholding your company’s esteemed reputation in the computer hardware industry.

Your task involves designing the combinational logic portion (i.e., not the sequential parts such as the flip-flops) of a Moore state machine. This state machine is characterized by having a single input, a single output, and four distinct states. The state encoding is predetermined as follows:
  • A is represented by 2'b00
  • B is represented by 2'b01
  • C is represented by 2'b10
  • D is represented by 2'b11

The provided state transition table lists the next state and the output (which is only a function of the current state, following Moore machine behavior) using the current state and the input signal:
  -----------------------------------------------------
         Next State for Input
    State       in = 0  in = 1  Output
        A         A    B     0
        B         C    B     0
        C         A    D     0
        D         C    B     1
  -----------------------------------------------------

Your assignment is to implement only the combinational logic that computes the next state (next_state) and the state-dependent output (out) based on this table. In other words, given the current state (state) and the input (in), your Verilog code should determine what the next state should be as well as the output signal in accordance with the Moore state machine described above.

Below is the provided module template to be completed:

-----------------------------------------------------
module top_module(
    input in,
    input [1:0] state,
    output [1:0] next_state,
    output out
);

    parameter A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3;

    // Insert your combinational logic implementation here
    // This includes:
    // - State transition logic: next_state = f(state, in)
    // - Output logic: out = f(state)

endmodule
-----------------------------------------------------

Please rework and expand this explanation if needed, ensuring that no solution or code is included, but clarify all requirements and design objectives for the implementation of this Verilog module.
