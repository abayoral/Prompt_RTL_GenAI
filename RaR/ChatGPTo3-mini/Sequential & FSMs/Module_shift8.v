Imagine you are serving as a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, and you are facing a high-stakes project related to the development of a Verilog module for an upcoming product generation. The performance and reliability of this module are crucial for upholding the esteemed reputation of your company in the competitive computer hardware industry.

Your task involves working with a pre-defined Verilog module named my_dff8 that has two inputs and one output. Specifically, the module:

• Accepts a clock signal (clk).
• Implements a set of 8 D flip-flops using an 8-bit input (d) and provides an 8-bit output (q).

The design challenge is to instantiate three copies of the my_dff8 module and connect them in a series configuration to create an 8-bit wide shift register with a total delay of three cycles. In other words, each copy of the module introduces one clock cycle delay, thereby chaining them together to form a three-stage pipeline.

Moreover, you need to implement a custom-designed 4-to-1 multiplexer (which is not supplied as part of the provided modules) that dynamically selects one of four input data signals depending on the value of a 2-bit select input (sel). Specifically, the multiplexer should choose from:

1. The very first value present at the input d (no clock cycle delay),
2. The output after the first D flip-flop (one clock cycle delay),
3. The output after the second D flip-flop (two clock cycles delay),
4. The output after the third D flip-flop (three clock cycles delay).

The role of the multiplexer is to provide flexibility in determining how many clock cycles (from zero to three) the original input should be delayed before being output as q. One potential approach to realize the multiplexer is to implement it within an always block and use a case statement that reacts to the different possible values of the sel input.

The template for your top-level module is provided below:

----------------------
module top_module ( 
    input clk, 
    input [7:0] d, 
    input [1:0] sel, 
    output [7:0] q 
);
    // Insert your code here
endmodule
----------------------

Your design must integrate the three instances of the my_dff8 module in a sequential chain to build the desired 3-stage shift register and also include the 4-to-1 multiplexer that selects the appropriate delayed data based on the sel input. This exercise requires careful coordination between the shift register chain and the multiplexer logic to ensure that data is correctly delayed by the specified number of clock cycles, thereby enabling precise control over the timing of the output signal q.

Do not provide any solutions or coding implementation details—your focus here is solely on understanding, clarifying, and elaborating the requirements of the task.
