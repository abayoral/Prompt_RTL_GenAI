Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working for a top hardware design company, and you have been assigned a crucial Verilog design task for an upcoming product. The module you design will be a timer that plays a key role in the functionality and reputation of your company’s computer hardware products.

Your goal is to implement a timer with a single data input line that functions as follows:

1. It initially listens for a specific four-bit sequence (1101). Only upon detecting this pattern should the timer begin its process.

2. Immediately after detecting the initial “start” sequence (1101), the module must shift in the subsequent four bits (one bit at a time, starting with the most significant bit). These four bits represent a delay value; you may refer to this as delay[3:0]. This delay value will determine how long the timer should count.

3. Once the delay value has been fully received, the timer should begin a counting phase. During this phase, an output signal (which we’ll call “counting”) is asserted to indicate that counting is in progress. The timer must count precisely (delay[3:0] + 1) multiplied by 1000 clock cycles. For example, if delay is 0, the timer should count 1000 clock cycles, and if delay is 5, it should count 6000 clock cycles.

4. In addition to tracking time internally, the module should provide a 4-bit output (denoted as “count”) showing the current remaining time in a specific stepped manner: for the first 1000 cycles it outputs the original delay value, then for the next 1000 cycles it outputs delay-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 for the final 1000 cycles.

5. After the counting phase is complete, the module must signal the end of the timer’s activity with an asserted “done” output. However, before resetting and looking for another start sequence, the module must wait until a user acknowledgment input (“ack”) is received. Only after this acknowledgment should the design reset and return to its initial state, where it begins monitoring the data input again for the next occurrence of the 1101 start pattern.

Additional details to consider:
• The serial data, carrying both the start sequence and the subsequent delay bits, arrives on a single data input pin.
• When the timer is not actively counting, the “count” output may be set to any convenient value (i.e., it is considered don’t-care).
• The design should feature a clean and maintainable structure; while it is acceptable to implement everything within a single module (module name: top_module) as long as you separate the different functionalities into distinct always or procedural blocks, care should be taken to avoid combining unrelated logic into a single block to minimize errors and enhance readability.
• The module should include a synchronous reset input (reset). When reset is asserted, the module should return to its initial state where it starts searching for the start sequence again.

Below is the module interface specification for your reference:

---------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,      // Synchronous reset
    input data,
    output [3:0] count,
    output counting,
    output done,
    input ack );
    
    // Your code will be inserted here
endmodule
---------------------------------------------------------------

Your task is to design this timer module in Verilog based on the detailed behavior described above. Remember, no solution or answer is needed—just ensure that all aspects of the question are clearly understood and elaborated.
