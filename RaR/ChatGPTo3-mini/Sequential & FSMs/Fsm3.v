Imagine you're a seasoned Digital Design Engineer within a prominent hardware design firm, and you have been tasked with a crucial project that will significantly influence your company’s reputation in the computer hardware industry. Your objective is to develop a Verilog module that implements a Moore state machine. This state machine is a vital component for a next-generation product, and as such, its correct functionality and design are of paramount importance.

The Moore state machine in question is defined by a state transition table with four distinct states (labeled A, B, C, and D), one data input (in), and one output (out). The behavior of the state machine is governed by the following transitions and output conditions:

• When the machine is in state A:
  – If in = 0, the next state remains A.
  – If in = 1, the machine transitions to state B.
  – The output is 0.

• When the machine is in state B:
  – If in = 0, the next state transitions to state C.
  – If in = 1, the next state remains B.
  – The output is 0.

• When the machine is in state C:
  – If in = 0, the machine transitions back to state A.
  – If in = 1, the next state is D.
  – The output remains 0.

• When the machine is in state D:
  – If in = 0, the next state transitions to state C.
  – If in = 1, the machine transitions to state B.
  – The output is 1.

Additionally, the design must incorporate an asynchronous reset (areset) that, when activated, immediately resets the state machine to state A regardless of the clock signal.

Your task is to design this module using Verilog, with the following interface defined:

Module: top_module
 – Inputs: clk (clock signal), in (state machine input), areset (asynchronous reset)
 – Output: out (state machine output)

Within your Verilog code, you should include:
 1. A state transition logic block that determines the next state based on the current state and the input.
 2. A set of state flip-flops that implement the state memory, sensitive to the clock, and capable of handling the asynchronous reset to state A.
 3. Output logic that generates the proper output based solely on the current state.

Your goal is to carefully structure and implement this state machine in Verilog according to the above specifications and state transition table. Do not produce any solutions or code implementations; focus your efforts only on understanding and clarifying the design requirements for this state machine module.
