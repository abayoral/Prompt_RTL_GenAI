Imagine you are a highly experienced Digital Design Engineer working for a top-tier hardware company. Your latest assignment is to design a critical Verilog module that will be a key component of an upcoming, state-of-the-art product. The performance and reliability of this module are essential not only for the success of the product but also for upholding the company's esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

Your task is to build a 4-digit binary-coded decimal (BCD) counter using Verilog. The counter should count in decimal, and each digit must be represented by four bits. Specifically, the least significant digit (ones place) is stored in q[3:0], the tens digit in q[7:4], the hundreds digit in q[11:8], and the most significant digit (thousands place) in q[15:12]. 

In addition to the count output, for the higher order three digits (tens, hundreds, and thousands), you are required to generate corresponding enable signals indicating when each of these digits should be incremented. These enable signals are bundled into a 3-bit output named "ena", with each bit representing one of the upper three digits.

Consideration may be given to reusing or modifying existing one-digit decade counter designs to streamline your implementation.

The module interface is defined as follows:

 • Inputs:
  – clk: The clock signal for synchronizing the counter operations.
  – reset: A synchronous active-high reset signal that should initialize the counter to its starting state.

 • Outputs:
  – ena [3:1]: A 3-bit signal array representing the enable status for the tens, hundreds, and thousands digits.
  – q [15:0]: A 16-bit output where each group of four bits stores one BCD digit, with q[3:0] as the ones digit, q[7:4] as the tens digit, q[11:8] as the hundreds digit, and q[15:12] as the thousands digit.

Your assignment is to write the Verilog module for this 4-digit BCD counter within the provided module template:

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,   // Synchronous active-high reset
    output [3:1] ena,
    output [15:0] q);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule

Remember, your focus areas should include proper reset handling, accurate BCD counting logic, and the generation of the appropriate enable signals for digit cascade increments. Do not include any implementation code or solutions here—your objective is only to clarify and understand the requirements thoroughly.
