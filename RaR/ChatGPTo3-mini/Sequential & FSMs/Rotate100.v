Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a top hardware design company, and you have been given a critical task for developing a Verilog module that will be central to a next-generation product. The module you need to design is a 100-bit register that functions both as a rotator and as a loader, playing a key role in sustaining your company's reputation for reliable, high-quality hardware.

Here’s a detailed description of the requirements:

1. The module must contain a 100-bit register. This register should be designed to handle two primary operations—loading new data and rotating the stored bits.

2. The “load” operation is synchronous. This means that when a dedicated load signal is asserted, the register should capture a new 100-bit value provided by an input. This operation should occur in lockstep with the system clock, ensuring that all bits are updated simultaneously.

3. The module should also support rotation. Unlike a conventional shifter, a rotator wraps the bit that gets shifted out on one end back into the other end. In simple terms, no bit is lost; the register’s state is merely rearranged.

4. The rotation operation is controlled by a two-bit enable signal named “ena.” The behavior of the module with respect to the enable signal is as follows:
   - When “ena” is set to 2’b01, the register should perform a one-bit right rotation. This means the least significant bit should wrap around and become the most significant bit.
   - When “ena” is 2’b10, the register should perform a one-bit left rotation, so the most significant bit wraps around to become the least significant.
   - If the enable signal is either 2’b00 or 2’b11, no rotation should occur; the register should maintain its current state.

5. Both the load and rotation operations must be executed in a synchronous manner, driven by the clock signal (“clk”). This ensures that any loading or bit rotation is synchronized with the system timing.

6. The output, labeled as “q,” should reflect the current state of the 100-bit register at any given time.

Your objective is to design a Verilog module with the given module signature that encapsulates all these behaviors. The module must carefully integrate synchronous data loading along with the conditional bit rotation based on the provided enable signals. No rotation should alter the actual bit contents unless specified by the enable controls, and the rotated bits should continuously wrap around, ensuring no loss of data during the shift.

This detailed rephrasing should help in understanding the task at hand: you are to implement a 100-bit register module in Verilog that can either load new data synchronously or rotate its bits left or right (in a circular manner) based on the control signals provided.
