Imagine you are an accomplished Digital Design Engineer at a top-tier hardware company, charged with creating a crucial piece of a next-generation Verilog design. The focus is on developing a top-level module for a shift register design where the success of this module is integral to upholding the company’s technological reputation.

Here’s what you need to accomplish:

1. Develop a top-level Verilog module named top_module that implements a shift register with a fixed length of 4 (n = 4). 

2. Within this top module, you are to incorporate four instances of a submodule called MUXDFF. Each instance represents one stage of the shift register.

3. The module is intended for implementation on the DE2 board, so specific connections between the board's inputs/outputs and your module are required:
   - The shift register’s R inputs should be directly connected to the 4-bit SW input (SW[3:0]).
   - The clock signal (clk) must be connected to KEY[0].
   - An enable signal (E) should be connected to KEY[1].
   - A load signal (L) must be connected to KEY[2].
   - An additional control signal (w) should be connected to KEY[3].
   - The outputs of the shift register should drive the red light LEDs (LEDR[3:0]).

4. You are provided with a code outline that includes the definitions for the top_module and the MUXDFF module. Your task is to complete the top_module by instantiating and wiring up the four MUXDFF subcircuits according to the connections mentioned above.

The problem requires careful planning of the interconnections between the top-level module and the submodules to ensure that all signals are correctly routed. The goal is to provide a solid structural foundation for the shift register design, which will be later integrated into a high-performance hardware project.

Note: Do not provide any answers or working solutions; simply focus on understanding and clarifying what the task requires.
