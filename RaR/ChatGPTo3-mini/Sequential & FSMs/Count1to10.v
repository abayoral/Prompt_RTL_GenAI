Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, and you have been assigned the development of a pivotal Verilog module for a next-generation product. This module plays a critical role in ensuring your company's reputation by performing an essential counting function.

Your task is to design and implement a decade counter module that counts sequentially from 1 through 10, inclusive. The requirements are as follows:

• The counter should increment its value on every positive clock edge.
• It must have a synchronous reset input. When the reset is activated, the counter should reset its value to 1, not 0.
• The counter’s current state is represented by a 4-bit output signal, allowing it to display values from 1 to 10 appropriately.

The Verilog module skeleton is provided with clock (clk), synchronous reset (reset), and a 4-bit output (q) declared. Your goal is to complete the implementation within the module based on these specifications.
