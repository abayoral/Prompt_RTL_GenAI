Below is an expanded and clarified version of the original question without any hints toward the solution:

Imagine that you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a top hardware design firm, and you have been given the challenge of creating a critical Verilog module for an upcoming product. The functionality of this module is extremely important since its successful operation is directly linked to maintaining the excellent reputation of your computer hardware company in the market.

The design revolves around managing the water level in a large reservoir that serves users. To achieve this, three sensors are arranged vertically with a 5-inch spacing between them. These sensors monitor the water level, and based on their status, the water inflow rate must be adjusted accordingly.

Here are the specifics:

1. If the water level is above the highest sensor (referred to as S3), the input water flow rate must be set to zero. In other words, no water should be added when the water is above S3.

2. If the water level is below the lowest sensor (S1), the reservoir must receive water at the maximum flow rate. This is done by simultaneously opening both the Nominal flow valve and the Supplemental flow valve.

3. When the water level falls between the highest sensor (S3) and the lowest sensor (S1), the flow rate is determined not only by which sensor(s) are activated (i.e., which range the water level is in) but also by considering the previous sensor input change. Each intermediate water level has an associated nominal flow rate as specified in the provided table.

4. Crucially, if a sensor change indicates that the water level is rising (meaning the previous sensor state represented a lower water level compared to the current state), then only the nominal flow rate should be applied. However, if the sensor change indicates a falling water level (that is, the previous state showed a higher level than now), then an increased water flow rate is required. This increase is achieved by additionally opening the Supplemental flow valve, which is controlled via a signal referred to as delta FR.

The design task is to develop a Moore finite state machine (FSM) that acts as a water reservoir controller. The following points must be clearly addressed in your design:

• Identifying each state of the system along with clear state transition conditions based on the sensor inputs.
• Clearly defining the outputs for each state. The outputs in your design include the signals FR1, FR2, FR3, and delta FR. These outputs correspond to the different flow control valves and adjustments required for different water level ranges.
• Taking into account the distinct water level ranges, the associated sensor statuses, and the adjustments to the flow rate. The corresponding table below summarizes these details:

  Water Level Range       Sensors Asserted          Nominal Flow Rate Outputs  
  • Above S3             S1, S2, S3                – None (no outputs activated)  
  • Between S3 and S2     S1, S2                    – FR1 active  
  • Between S2 and S1     S1                        – FR1 and FR2 active  
  • Below S1             None                      – FR1, FR2, and FR3 active  

• In addition to the water level management, you are also required to incorporate an active-high synchronous reset into your design. When this reset signal is asserted, the FSM should immediately revert to a state that is equivalent to a scenario where the water level has been low for an extended period. This means that none of the sensors are active and all four outputs (FR1, FR2, FR3, and delta FR) are asserted.

The start of the Verilog module is provided as a template, and you are expected to fill in the module with your design:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [3:1] s,
    output fr3,
    output fr2,
    output fr1,
    output dfr
); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your task is to develop this FSM in Verilog. When you work on your design, ensure that you clearly indicate each state along with the conditions for transitioning between states and specify the outputs for every state in the Moore model. Remember to implement the sensor logic, flow rate control based on the table provided, the previous level comparison to determine whether delta FR should be used, and the asynchronous reset behavior.

Your final design should coherently capture the operational requirements of a water reservoir controller, integrating both sensor inputs and output control signals in a systematic FSM structure.
