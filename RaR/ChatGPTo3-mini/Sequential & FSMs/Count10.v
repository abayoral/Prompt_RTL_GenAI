Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, and you have been entrusted with a crucial assignment. Your task is to design a Verilog module that implements a decade counter. This counter must count sequentially from 0 to 9, meaning it should cycle through these values for a total period of 10 clock cycles. An important aspect of this design is that the counter should feature a synchronous reset, which, when activated (active-high), will set the counter's value back to 0 on the rising edge of the clock. 

In this scenario, ensure that your Verilog module includes the necessary inputs (a clock and the synchronous reset) and outputs (a 4-bit output representing the counter value). The design must adhere strictly to the specified counting sequence and reset behavior. The challenge lies in creating a robust design that meets these functional requirements while maintaining high standards of reliability and performance expected in next-generation hardware products. 

Remember, your focus is solely on understanding and elaborating the problem statementâ€”no solution or code implementation is provided here.
