Imagine you have been assigned a crucial task as a senior Digital Design Engineer for a prominent hardware design company. Your responsibility is to design and implement a Verilog module that is a key component in a next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is essential for maintaining your company’s prestigious reputation in computer hardware design.

The module you develop must take a 1000 Hz clock input and generate a 1 Hz output signal—referred to as OneHertz. This 1 Hz signal will serve as an enable signal for driving a group of hour/minute/second counters, which together form the digital logic of a wall clock. It is critical that the OneHertz signal is high for exactly one cycle every second, ensuring that the clock counts accurately once per second.

To create this frequency divider, you are required to use modulo-10 (BCD) counters, incorporating as few additional logic gates as possible. Additionally, your design must provide enable outputs from each of the BCD counters used in the divider. These outputs are expected to be available on a three-bit bus labeled c_enable, where:
•	c_enable[0] corresponds to the fastest counter,
•	c_enable[2] corresponds to the slowest counter.

A BCD counter module is provided as part of the project. It operates with the following characteristics:
•	The counter has an input clock (clk), a synchronous reset (reset) that, when high, forces the counter to zero, and an enable input (enable) that allows the counter to run when high.
•	The output is a 4-bit register (Q) representing the current count.

The provided code snippet shows the instantiation of two BCD counters within a top-level module named top_module. Within this module:
•	The input clock (clk) and a reset signal (reset) are directly connected to every BCD counter.
•	There is a placeholder for instantiating the counters and wiring up the enable signals appropriately.
•	At least two BCD counters (counter0 and counter1) are partially instantiated, with the fastest counter’s enable indicated as c_enable[0] and so on.

Your design challenge is to complete and extend this top_module:
1. Derive the 1 Hz OneHertz signal using the provided 1000 Hz input.
2. Appropriately cascade the modulo-10 counters to perform the frequency division.
3. Generate and output the enable signals from each counter on the c_enable bus, ensuring that these signals correctly reflect the operation of the fast and slow counters.
4. Use as few additional logic gates as possible, relying primarily on the provided BCD counters for counting functionality.

This task requires a careful and efficient design approach to meet the strict timing and signal generation requirements of a digital wall clock application, ensuring that every component, from the frequency divider to the resultant enable signals for the counters, operates flawlessly in synchronization with the 1000 Hz system clock.

Remember, you are to elaborate on the design challenge, providing clear specifications and design goals. Do not include any code solutions or implementation details beyond clarifying the requirements.
