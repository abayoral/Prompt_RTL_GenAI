Imagine you are a senior digital design engineer at a premier hardware design firm, and you have been entrusted with the development of a key Verilog module for an upcoming next-generation product. The reliability and performance of this module are crucial for upholding your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

The module's primary function is to monitor an 8-bit input signal, where each bit is analyzed independently. Your task is to detect instances where any individual bit transitions from a logical 0 in one clock cycle to a logical 1 in the following cycle—this is akin to performing positive edge detection for each bit within the vector. When a 0-to-1 transition is identified for a specific bit, the system must ensure that the corresponding bit in the 8-bit output is set (i.e., asserted) exactly one cycle after the transition has occurred.

The module's interface includes a clock signal (clk), an 8-bit input vector (in), and an 8-bit output vector (pedge) that should reflect these detected edge transitions. You are to design and document the internal logic of this module in Verilog, ensuring that it accurately captures and processes these transitions in a synchronous manner.

This question requires you to explain your approach for implementing this functionality in Verilog, detailing the necessary considerations and design choices that will guarantee accurate detection and timing of the output signal based on the input transitions. No code or specific implementation details should be provided in the response—focus entirely on clarifying and elaborating the requirements and intent of this design task.
