Imagine you have been assigned the critical task of developing a Verilog module that plays a central role in a state-of-the-art hardware product. In this challenge, your objective is to implement a top-level module that constructs a three-stage shift register using instances of a basic D flip-flop module. This D flip-flop module, called my_dff, has two inputs (clk and d) and one output (q). 

Your assignment involves the following key points:

• You must instantiate three copies of the provided my_dff module.
• These three instances need to be connected in series to form a shift register of length three. In other words, the output of one flip-flop should become the input (d) for the next stage in the chain.
• The clk signal from the top-level module must be connected to the clk input of each of the three my_dff instances.
• You are to integrate these instances within the top_module, which is defined with the inputs clk and d, and an output q.

The focus of the problem is on correctly instantiating and chaining the my_dff modules to achieve the desired shift register functionality. The successful implementation of this module is crucial, as it directly impacts the performance and reputation of your company’s next-generation hardware products.

How would you go about coding the top_module to satisfy these requirements?

Remember, the goal here is to ensure a clear understanding of instantiation, module chaining, and signal propagation in a Verilog design for a shift register.
