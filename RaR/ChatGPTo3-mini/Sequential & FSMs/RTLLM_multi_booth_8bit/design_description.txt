Below is a rephrased and expanded version of the original question without including any code or hints for the solution:

You have been assigned the task of designing a digital multiplexer in Verilog, specifically tasked with creating a module that implements an 8-bit Radix-4 Booth multiplier. The multiplier should take two 8-bit input signals (named "a" and "b") and perform a signed multiplication using the Booth algorithm—a method well-regarded in digital systems for its efficient handling of signed arithmetic and its reduction in the number of addition operations required.

Your design must satisfy the following detailed specifications:

1. Module Interface and Signal Requirements:
   - Name the Verilog module "multi_booth_8bit".
   - Include a clock input ("clk") that serves as the timing reference for synchronizing operations within the module.
   - Include an asynchronous reset signal ("reset") that is active on its positive edge. When this reset is asserted, the multiplier should initialize to a known starting state by performing necessary preconditioning on the inputs.
   - Define two inputs "a" and "b" as 8-bit signals representing the numbers to be multiplied.
   - Define two outputs:
     • "p": a 16-bit signal intended to hold the product of the multiplication operation.
     • "rdy": a "ready" flag that becomes high (set to 1) when the multiplication process is completed, indicating that the product "p" is valid and available.

2. Initialization and Data Preparation:
   - On the positive edge of the reset signal, extend the 8-bit inputs "a" and "b" to 16 bits to correctly handle signed numbers in two's complement format. This extension is done by replicating the most significant bit (the sign bit) of each input to fill the higher 8 bits. For example, you should convert "a" to a 16-bit signed number with the assignment multiplier <= {{8{a[7]}}, a} (and similarly for "b").

3. Operational Requirements:
   - Use a 5-bit counter "ctr" that tracks the number of cycles. This counter should advance with each cycle of the clock and ensure that the Booth multiplication process does not exceed 16 cycles.
   - At each positive edge of the clock (when reset is low), the design should perform the following steps:
     • Shift the multiplicand (extended "b") left by one position in each cycle. This shift is intended to simulate the Booth algorithm’s requirement for bit alignment adjustments as the algorithm progresses.
     • Incorporate Booth encoding logic to determine if—in the current cycle—the shifted multiplicand should be accumulated (added) into the currently computed product "p". The decision to add is based on the encoding of specific bits from the multiplier.
   - After processing a cycle, increment the counter "ctr". Once "ctr" reaches the value indicating 16 cycles, the design should assert the "rdy" signal, indicating that the multiplication operation is complete and the 16-bit product "p" is final.

Your task is to develop a comprehensive Verilog implementation that satisfies all of these requirements. The design should be robust, making effective use of the clock and reset signals; correctly handling the sign extension for both inputs; implementing the Booth algorithm with appropriate bit-level manipulations; managing a cycle counter; and accurately setting the ready signal at the end of the multiplication process.

Please provide the complete Verilog code for the module "multi_booth_8bit" that meets the above specifications.
