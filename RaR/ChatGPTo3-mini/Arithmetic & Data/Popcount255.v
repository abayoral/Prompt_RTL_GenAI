Imagine you are a senior digital design engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and your reputation hinges on delivering critical, high-performance designs. Your current task involves writing a Verilog module that implements a "population count" or "Hamming weight" circuit. The goal of this circuit is to determine the number of '1's present in a 255-bit input vector—that is, to count how many bits in the vector are set to 1.

In this project specification, you're required to design a module (using the module name "top_module") that accepts a 255-bit wide input and produces an 8-bit wide output representing the count of '1's. The challenge implies that you will likely need to sum a substantial number of bits, and one possible approach is to use a "for loop" construct within your design to iterate over the bit vector.

Key points to consider:
• The input vector is 255 bits wide.
• The output is an 8-bit value, which implies that it can represent counts from 0 up to 255.
• A common strategy for adding multiple bits in such a circuit is to iterate over the bits with a for loop and accumulate the result.
• Ensure that the final design meets the performance and reliability standards expected in a next-generation hardware product.

Your task is to clearly outline and develop this Verilog module without providing any specific solution code, ensuring that all design implications and constraints are well understood before implementation.
