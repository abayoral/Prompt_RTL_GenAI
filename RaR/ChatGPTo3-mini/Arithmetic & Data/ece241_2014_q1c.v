Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a top-tier hardware design company, and you’ve been assigned a critical task. Your challenge is to create a Verilog module that will be an integral part of a next-generation product. The module's successful implementation is crucial to maintaining the excellent reputation of your computer hardware company in the competitive market.

The task involves working with two 8-bit numbers that are encoded in 2's complement form. These numbers, labeled as "a" and "b", will be processed to produce an 8-bit output "s" that represents their sum. In addition to the sum, your module will need to automatically generate a signal named "overflow". This signal should indicate whether a signed overflow has occurred during the addition process.

Remember, a signed overflow occurs under one of two conditions: 
1. When two positive numbers are added and the result is negative.
2. When two negative numbers are added and the result is positive.

There are multiple design techniques you might consider for detecting overflow. One common approach is to compare the sign bits of the input numbers with the sign bit of the output sum. Alternatively, some designs determine overflow by examining the carries into and out of the most significant bit positions (specifically bit 7 and bit 6, given 8-bit numbers).

The module declaration is given as follows:

module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
);

Within this module, you are expected to write the Verilog code that:
• Assigns the result of a plus b to the output s.
• Determines and assigns the correct state (true or false) to the 'overflow' output, based on whether a signed overflow occurred.

Your objective is to clearly and correctly structure the module in Verilog to meet these specifications, ensuring that both the sum and the overflow indicator are computed accurately. 

Note: Do not provide any test benches or additional output, and do not include any solutions or hints beyond what is detailed here. Your focus should solely be on effectively clarifying and elaborating on the requirements of this question.
