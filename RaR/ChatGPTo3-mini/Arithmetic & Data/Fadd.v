Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working for a top-tier hardware design company. You have been assigned a mission-critical task that involves developing a Verilog module for a cutting-edge product. The company’s reputation in the competitive computer hardware market hinges on the successful implementation of this module.

The objective is to design and implement a Verilog module that functions as a full adder. This module must accept three input bits—two primary data bits and an additional carry-in bit—and then accurately compute two outputs: the sum of these inputs and the resulting carry-out bit.

The framework provided for this task includes a module declaration with specific input and output ports as shown below:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module( 
    input a, b, cin,
    output cout, sum );

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Your challenge is to develop the necessary Verilog code within this module framework that correctly implements the full adder behavior. Ensure that your design accounts for all possible input combinations, properly computing the sum and determining the correct carry-out. You are expected to adhere to best digital design practices since this module will play a pivotal role in the overall performance and reliability of the hardware product.

Note: This task strictly requires the development of the Verilog module code. Please ensure that you provide only the requested module implementation without including any supplementary design discussions or extraneous code.
