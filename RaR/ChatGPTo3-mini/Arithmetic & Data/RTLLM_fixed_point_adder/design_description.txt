Consider the following comprehensive task in Verilog design:

Your assignment is to create a parameterized module, named fixed_point_adder, which implements a fixed-point adder capable of handling arithmetic operations with a specific fixed level of precision. The module should be designed to work with fixed-point numbers by using parameters to set both the total bit-width and the number of fractional bits. Below are the key elements and requirements that your design must address:

1. Module Name:
   - fixed_point_adder

2. Parameters:
   - Q: This parameter defines the number of bits allocated for the fractional part of the fixed-point numbers. It determines how fine-grained the fractional representation will be and directly affects the precision of the arithmetic operations.
   - N: This parameter determines the total bit-width of the numbers, including both the integer and fractional segments. It sets the overall size of the input operands as well as the result.

3. Input Ports:
   - a [N-1:0]: The first input operand represented as a fixed-point number with N bits.
   - b [N-1:0]: The second input operand, also an N-bit fixed-point number.

4. Output Port:
   - c [N-1:0]: This is the output that will provide the N-bit result after performing the fixed-point addition of the operands a and b.

5. Internal Registers:
   - res [N-1:0]: An internal register meant to temporarily hold the result, which is derived from either the addition or subtraction performed on the absolute values of the input operands. This register will help in managing the intermediate calculation steps.

6. Functional Requirements and Implementation Details:

   a. Absolute Value Addition:
      - In cases where the most significant bits (MSBs) of both inputs a and b are identical (indicating that both are either positive or negative), your module should perform addition using the absolute values of these operands.
      - Ensure that the sign of the result, as reflected by the MSB of the internal register res, remains consistent with the sign of the inputs.

   b. Absolute Value Subtraction:
      - When the MSBs of a and b differ (which implies that one operand is positive and the other negative), your module must first compare the absolute values of the inputs.
      - Based on this comparison, decide whether to subtract a from b or vice versa. The calculation must handle the sign appropriately, ensuring that the MSB of the outcome correctly represents whether the result is negative or non-zero.

   c. Fixed-point Precision Handling:
      - Since a and b are represented with both integer and fractional parts (with the fractional precision defined by Q), all arithmetic operations, including addition and subtraction, must observe and maintain this precision.
      - The approach should guarantee that the fixed-point arithmetic is consistent across inputs and the resulting output.

   d. Overflow Management:
      - The design must include measures to address potential overflow situations.
      - Monitor the MSB to ensure the computed result fits within the defined N-bit range, and implement appropriate safeguards if the result exceeds the allowable range.

Your task is to integrate all these specifications into a complete Verilog code that effectively realizes the described functionalities in the fixed_point_adder module. Remember, no solution or code is expected to be explained here; focus on understanding the requirements and planning a design that meets all these outlined criteria.
