Imagine you are a highly experienced Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, playing a crucial role in driving the innovation for a next-generation product. In this scenario, you have been assigned a vital task: designing a Verilog module that implements a half adder. The half adder is a fundamental building block in digital arithmetic circuits, responsible for adding two single-bit binary numbers. It operates without a carry-in input and generates two outputsâ€”a sum and a carry-out.

Your objective is to create a Verilog module named "top_module" that adheres to the following specifications:

1. It must have two single-bit inputs labeled "a" and "b".
2. It should produce two outputs:
   - "sum": representing the sum of the two input bits.
   - "cout": representing the carry-out, which indicates if there is an overflow from the addition.
3. Your Verilog code should clearly define the module interface, leaving a placeholder where the implementation details will be inserted.

Keep in mind that the success of this module is critical to upholding the reputation of your company in the competitive computer hardware industry. Focus on ensuring the code is well-structured and ready for integration into a high-stakes project.

Write the Verilog module exactly as described, outlining the interface and including a comment where your implementation code will go, without providing the actual logic for the half adder.
