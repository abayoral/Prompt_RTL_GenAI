Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company. Your company’s reputation hinges on the development of a critical Verilog module for an upcoming, state-of-the-art product. The task at hand involves constructing an adder-subtractor circuit using the provided elements and guidelines.

The objective is to design a module that performs both addition and subtraction on 32-bit operands, where the operation is determined by a control signal. You are supplied with a reliable 16-bit adder module defined as follows:

  module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );

Your role is to instantiate this 16-bit adder module twice in order to cover the full 32-bit width of the operands. Additionally, the problem specifies that a 32-bit wide XOR gate should be used to invert the second operand (b) when the 'sub' control signal is active. Essentially, treat the XOR operation as b[31:0] XORed with 32 copies of the 'sub' bit. The same control signal 'sub' must also be connected to the adder's carry-in input to correctly perform subtraction when needed.

The hint provided clarifies that an XOR gate can function as a programmable inverter: one input controls whether the other input will be inverted.

Your top-level module, named top_module, is declared with the following interface:

  module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    input sub,
    output [31:0] sum
  );

Your task is to develop the internal logic of top_module. This involves properly instantiating the two add16 modules, ensuring correct handling of bit widths, making proper connections for the operands and control signals, and implementing the XOR-based inversion for the appropriate wide operand. 

Rephrase this task in your own words, detailing how you will approach instantiating the modules, handling the inversion of b based on the sub signal, and correctly setting up the carry-in for the addition/subtraction operation, all while ensuring the final output is a 32-bit result. No sample solutions or code should be provided—your goal is simply to clarify and elaborate the problem's requirements.
