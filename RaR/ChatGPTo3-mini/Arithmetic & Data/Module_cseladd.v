Imagine that you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and you have been assigned a highly critical task to develop a Verilog module for a new, next-generation product. The success of this module is of utmost importance because it plays a critical role in upholding your company's reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

The problem involves working with an existing module named add16, which you are already familiar with from previous exercises. This add16 module is designed to add two 16-bit numbers along with an input carry (cin), and it outputs both a 16-bit sum and an output carry (cout). The module is declared as follows:

  module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );

Your objective is to combine three instances of the add16 module to construct a large carry-select adder. A key part of this task also involves designing and integrating your own 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer, which will help in managing the different possible sums based on the carry selection mechanism.

To summarize, you are required to:
1. Instantiate three add16 modules to form the backbone of the carry-select adder circuit.
2. Design a custom 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer that will correctly choose between the partial summations generated by the add16 modules.
3. Connect these modules appropriately according to a provided block diagram (not included here) to ensure the carry-select adder functions as intended.

The top-level module for your design is outlined below:

  module top_module(
   input [31:0] a,
   input [31:0] b,
   output [31:0] sum
  );
  
  // Insert your code here
  
  endmodule

Your task is to fill in the missing code within the top_module by wiring the three add16 modules together with your custom multiplexer as per the design requirements and the diagram provided. The focus is on accurately implementing the described functionality using Verilog.

Please note: No code solutions or verilog implementations should be provided at this stage; the task is purely to rephrase and understand the requirements of the design exercise.
