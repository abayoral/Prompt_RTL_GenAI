Imagine you are a senior digital design engineer working at a top-tier hardware design company, responsible for developing a critical Verilog module for a cutting-edge product. Your task is to create a highly reliable 100-bit binary adder module that forms a key component for the next-generation hardware. This module must be capable of taking in two 100-bit binary numbers along with a single carry-in bit, processing the addition, and then producing a 100-bit sum along with a carry-out bit.

The primary challenge here is to implement the adder efficiently without instantiating an overwhelming number of individual full adder modules, since manually creating 100 full adders is not a scalable solution. Instead, you are encouraged to use behavioral Verilog coding techniques to succinctly define the desired functionality.

In summary, your assignment involves:
1. Designing a Verilog module that accepts two 100-bit inputs (representing the numbers to be added) and a single carry-in bit.
2. Producing a 100-bit output for the sum, as well as a single carry-out bit as the result of the addition.
3. Implementing the design using behavioral coding to manage the complexity, as the direct instantiation of numerous full adder components is impractical.

The goal is to ensure that the adder module is both efficient and maintainable, while meeting the performance and reliability standards expected from a mission-critical hardware module.
