As a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a renowned hardware design company, you are faced with the critical task of developing a Verilog module aimed at enhancing the company's next-generation product line. The module you are designing is of utmost importance as it plays a key role in upholding the companyâ€™s esteemed reputation within the highly competitive computer hardware industry.

Your specific assignment involves the creation of a sophisticated timer module characterized by several distinct functionalities, outlined as follows:

1. **Pattern Detection**: The fundamental requirement is for the timer to initiate when it detects a specific sequential pattern, represented by the binary sequence '1101,' on a serial data input. This detection serves as the trigger to start the timer operation.

2. **Determination of Delay Duration**: Once the trigger sequence '1101' is encountered, the module must proceed to shift in an additional set of four bits. This mechanism is crucial as these bits are inherently intended to determine the duration for which the timer will eventually delay.

3. **Counter Integration**: Following the acquisition of the delay duration, the module needs to effectively engage in a waiting phase. During this phase, it will rely on external counter operations to carry out the delay specified by the four bits. The module must exhibit competency in distinguishing when the counters have completed their task.

4. **User Notification**: Upon the conclusion of the counting process, it becomes imperative for the module to alert the user about the completion of the timed period. The state machine must output a signal to indicate this status clearly.

5. **Acknowledgment and Reset**: A user acknowledgment signal is required to reset the state machine, preparing it to scan for the next occurrence of the initiating sequence '1101.' This ensures the module is ready for subsequent cycles of operation.

Your immediate task entails the design and implementation of a finite-state machine (FSM) dedicated to managing this intricate operation flow within the timer module. It's important to clarify that your focus at present is solely on orchestrating the control logic using the FSM. The data path elements, including counters and comparators, though critical to the overall design, are not part of this current phase.

The challenge involves configuring specific input and output pins on your module as follows:
- `clk`: Serves as the clock input that synchronizes all timer operations.
- `reset`: A synchronous reset line to initialize the FSM's state and logic.
- `data`: The serial data input monitored for the '1101' pattern.
- `shift_ena`: An output signal that should be asserted precisely for 4 consecutive clock cycles following pattern detection.
- `counting`: A signal asserted during the period in which the module is waiting on the counter to complete counting based on the shifted bits.
- `done_counting`: An input indicating the completion of the counter process and necessitating the next phase.
- `done`: This output signal notifies the user that the timing period has concluded.
- `ack`: An input that serves to acknowledge the completion signal from the user, allowing the FSM to reset and seek the next trigger sequence.

Your goal is to architect the FSM to transition through the necessary states accurately, handling the shift enablement, managing the interaction with external counting, and implementing user notification and acknowledgment. Ensure that after receiving acknowledgment, the FSM returns its focus to detecting the initiation sequence '1101' efficiently to perpetuate the timer's operation cycle.
