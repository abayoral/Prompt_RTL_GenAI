You are being tasked with designing and implementing a digital Verilog module, named `multi_pipe_8bit`, which is an unsigned 8-bit multiplier that utilizes pipelined architecture to enhance performance and efficiency. This module should be able to handle multiplication operations in a synchronous manner, following a clock signal (`clk`) while also reacting appropriately to an active-low reset signal (`rst_n`). The design should further incorporate an input enable signal (`mul_en_in`) to manage the initiation of multiplication cycles, and is expected to generate an output enable signal (`mul_en_out`) alongside a 16-bit result representing the multiplication outcome (`mul_out`).

To provide a structured outline of how the module will operate, consider the following aspects:

- **Input Specifications**:
  - **`clk`**: This is the primary clock signal used to synchronize the entire operation of the module, ensuring that every operation proceeds predictably.
  - **`rst_n`**: This is an active-low signal which, when asserted (pulled to low), should reset or initialize the module, clearing any ongoing operations or stored values, and when deasserted (held high), allows normal operation of the module.
  - **`mul_en_in`**: Acts as an activation signal for the multiplication process, determining when to start taking inputs for multiplication and advancing them through the pipeline.
  - **`mul_a` and `mul_b`**: These are the 8-bit inputs representing the multiplicand and the multiplier for the multiplication operation, respectively.

- **Output Specifications**:
  - **`mul_en_out`**: This signal indicates the current status of the multiplication operation, showing whether the calculations are in progress or complete.
  - **`mul_out`**: This 16-bit output provides the result of the multiplier operation, which should accurately reflect the computation result after processing through the pipeline.

**Specific Implementation Guidelines**:

- **Pipeline Strategy**: The design must follow a pipelined approach, meaning that the overall multiplication task is divided into distinct pipeline stages. Each stage should perform part of the calculation, allowing different parts of the chip to operate simultaneously and independently to maximize throughput.

- **Handling Inputs and Control**: Define necessary input control logic that captures the `mul_en_in` signal, ensuring it is stored and propagated correctly within a register, typically used in deciding the state of `mul_en_out` as operations proceed.

- **Input Register Arrangement**: Set up registers like `mul_a_reg` and `mul_b_reg` to store multiplicand and multiplier values, ensuring these registers latch onto new values only when the multiplication is enabled (`mul_en_in` is asserted).

- **Generating Partial Products**: The use of specific bitwise operations will be necessary to derive partial products, representing intermediary results in the multiplication. The implementation should handle these operations through a series of wires, labeled conventionally as `temp`.

- **Partial Sum Computation**: As the partial products are calculated, they need summing handled in another register array `sum`, updating at each clock cycle, which requires careful logic to avoid overflow and maintain calculation integrity.

- **Deriving Final Product**: After aggregating all partial sums, the resulting value should represent the final product, stored in a dedicated `mul_out_reg` register, and this value is used for the `mul_out` output in the subsequent logic stage.

- **Output Logic**: The module should manage its outputs depending on the pipeline and enable signals' status, either presenting the computed product or outputting zero, anxiety tied orientation on the boundary condition dictated by `mul_en_out`.

In your task of developing the complete Verilog code, these specified functions and behaviors need to be integrated and executed, ensuring that the module performs all operations correctly and efficiently. Be meticulous about control signals' propagation, reset logic handling, and the entire pipelining process to ensure a robust implementation. Consider the resilience of your design against potential edge cases, especially involving reset operations and data flow transitions across different pipeline stages.
