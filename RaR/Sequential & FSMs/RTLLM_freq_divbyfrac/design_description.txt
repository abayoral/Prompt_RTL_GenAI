I am seeking assistance in designing a Verilog hardware description module titled `freq_divbyfrac`. This module is intended to act as a frequency divider that can take an input clock signal and reduce its frequency by a non-integer, or fractional, factor. Specifically, my objective is to divide the signal's frequency by a factor of 3.5. In order to attain this fractional division, the implementation should utilize a technique known as double-edge clocking, which allows the handling of fractional or half-integer divisions in a manner that accounts for potential imbalances in the duty cycle.

The design approach involves the strategic division of clock cycles into uneven segments and utilizing phase-shifting methodologies to generate a seamlessly transitioned fractional output clock signal. The idea is to create an intermediate clock signal that undergoes intentional division and temporal adjustment to achieve the desired output frequency.

Below are the necessary ports for designing the module:
- **Input Ports:**
  - `clk`: This represents the primary clock signal input that will undergo the frequency division process.
  - `rst_n`: An active low reset signal that serves the purpose of setting the module into an initial, stable state.

- **Output Port:**
  - `clk_div`: This serves as the output port where the adjusted clock signal, now divided by the desired fractional frequency, will be available.

In terms of implementation, the frequency division process should operate by counting the clock cycles. For a division factor of 3.5x, the module would cycle through 7 clock periods, which is calculated based on the multiplied divisor (referred to as MUL2_DIV_CLK = 7). Within these 7 periods, two distinct subsets of clock periods are to be defined: one comprising 4 original clock cycles and the other, 3 original clock cycles.

Following the division phase, a phase adjustment operation should be performed to create two distinct versions of the divided clock signal. One version should be deferred by half a clock period, while the other should be expedited by half a clock period. These two phase-offset clock signals are then logically combined, specifically using an OR operation, to produce the final output signal. This ensures that the resultant fractional divided clock maintains a stable and uniform period throughout its cycle.

Would you be able to provide a comprehensive Verilog code implementation that adheres to the above specifications and considerations, ensuring that the specific functional objectives and timing requirements are met?
