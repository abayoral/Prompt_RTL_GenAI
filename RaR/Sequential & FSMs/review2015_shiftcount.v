You are tasked with a significant project at your role as a senior Digital Design Engineer within a leading company in hardware design, and this particular task is a cornerstone for your company's continued reputation in the competitive field of computer hardware. You are to develop a four-bit shift register Verilog module that plays a dual role within a next-generation productâ€”both as a shift register and as a down counter. The dual functionality is critical, as it allows the same set of hardware to perform multiple operations, optimizing space and resources.

The module should be developed using Verilog and incorporates key functionalities: 

1. **Shift Register Operation**: The module should support the shifting of data in the register, with data being shifted in starting from the most significant bit (MSB) when the `shift_ena` signal is active (set to 1). 

2. **Down Counter Operation**: The module must also act as a down counter, decrementing the current value stored in the register whenever the `count_ena` signal is active (set to 1).

An important consideration is that the overall system design ensures no scenario occurs where both the `shift_ena` and `count_ena` signals are active (set to 1) simultaneously. Therefore, the functionality of the module when both signals are active concurrently is neither defined nor significant, allowing you the flexibility to choose which operation, if any, should take precedence in such impossible cases, or to simply ignore this condition entirely.

Given this outline, your duties involve crafting the module code which must accurately integrate these operations within the framework of a top-level module, taking `clk`, `shift_ena`, `count_ena`, and `data` as inputs and providing a 4-bit output `q` reflecting the current state of the shift register. You must pay attention to the specific logic transitions that govern when and how shifting and counting operations are executed. Below is the template for your module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input shift_ena,
    input count_ena,
    input data,
    output [3:0] q);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Your implementation is a critical factor in influencing the success and reliability of this next-generation product, emphasizing not only technical accuracy but also efficiency and robustness of the Verilog design.
