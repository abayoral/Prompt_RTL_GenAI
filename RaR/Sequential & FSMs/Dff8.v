Imagine you're in the role of a senior Digital Design Engineer at a top-tier hardware design company. Your expertise is being relied upon to develop a crucial Verilog module that is integral to the launch of a next-generation product. The effectiveness and reliability of this module are essentialâ€”not only for the product's success but also for upholding your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive computer hardware industry.

The task at hand involves creating a set of 8 D flip-flops. These D flip-flops should be designed to operate based on the condition that they are triggered by the positive edge of a clock signal, denoted as `clk`. The challenge is to develop this functionality within the context of a Verilog module, which has been provisionally named `top_module`.

Here's a breakdown of what is required in the module's structure:

- The `top_module` should be able to accept two main inputs:
  1. `clk`: This is the clock signal which serves as the trigger for the D flip-flops, and it should specifically respond to its rising or positive edge.
  2. `d`: This is an 8-bit wide input vector that provides the data to be stored by the flip-flops.

- An output signal, `q`, is also necessary. This will be an 8-bit wide output vector representing the stored values of the D flip-flops at any given time.

Your task is to write the code required to instantiate and connect these 8 D flip-flops properly within the `top_module`, ensuring that they function in accordance with the specified requirements. Each flip-flop should capture its respective data bit from the input `d` and output it through `q` on the positive edge of `clk`, thereby ensuring synchronous data processing. The completion and flawless performance of this module are crucial, underscoring the importance of precision and accuracy in your design approach.
