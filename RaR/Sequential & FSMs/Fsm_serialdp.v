As a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prestigious hardware design company, you have been entrusted with the responsibility of developing an essential Verilog module for an upcoming next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is vital to uphold the company's esteemed reputation within the computer hardware industry.

The specific task at hand involves enhancing a serial receiver by incorporating parity checking—a technique that appends an additional bit to each data byte. In this case, odd parity is to be implemented, which ensures the total number of 1s among the 9 bits received (comprising the 8 data bits plus one parity bit) is odd. For example, the binary sequence 101001011 is valid under odd parity because it contains five 1s, which is an odd number, whereas the sequence 001001011 is invalid because it has four 1s.

Your challenge is to adapt the existing finite state machine (FSM) and datapath to accommodate this odd parity checking. The FSM must now assert a 'done' signal only when a byte is correctly received and its parity check is successful. This involves detecting a start bit, accurately receiving all 9 bits (including the parity bit), and subsequently verifying the correctness of the stop bit. If the stop bit does not appear as expected, the FSM should remain idle until a stop bit is detected before attempting to receive a new byte.

To aid in the parity checking process, you have access to a predefined module designed for parity calculation. This module functions as a toggle flip-flop (TFF) with a reset capability, intended to process the input bit stream and reset accordingly to count the number of 1 bits in each received byte.

Here is a brief overview of how the module functions:
```verilog
module parity (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input in,
    output reg odd);

    always @(posedge clk)
        if (reset) odd <= 0;
        else if (in) odd <= ~odd;
endmodule
```

It’s important to note that the serial protocol transmits the least significant bit (LSB) first, followed by the parity bit after the 8 data bits have been sent.

The task requires you to modify the code within the `top_module` to integrate parity checking into the existing FSM and datapath. Consider carefully the transition states and logic needed to handle the new parity checking requirements while ensuring the serial data reception continues to operate effectively.
