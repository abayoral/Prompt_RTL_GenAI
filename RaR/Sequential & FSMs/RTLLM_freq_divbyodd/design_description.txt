As an experienced Verilog designer, your task is to develop a sophisticated digital module in Verilog, explicitly designed as a frequency divider capable of dividing an input clock signal by an odd integer factor. The module, which will be named `freq_divbyodd`, is expected to take an incoming clock signal and produce an output clock signal that operates at a frequency reduced by a specified odd integer divisor.

**Input Ports:**
- `clk`: This is the primary input clock signal, serving as the timing reference for the entire system. The goal is to programmatically alter its frequency by executing a division process.
- `rst_n`: This is an active low reset signal, crucial for initializing the system's state. When triggered, it ensures that the module resets to a known, stable starting condition, which is essential for reliable operation.

**Output Port:**
- `clk_div`: The output port that delivers the frequency-divided clock signal. This signal reflects the input clock frequency reduced by the specified odd divisor. Ensuring the integrity and timing precision of this signal is critical, as it often drives subsequent stages in a digital system.

**Module Description:**
- The main functionality of the module lies in dividing the input clock frequency by an odd integer value defined by a parameter, `NUM_DIV`. By default, this parameter is set to 5, though it is configurable to any other odd divisor, offering significant flexibility and adaptation to various application requirements.
- To achieve the division process, two counters, `cnt1` and `cnt2`, are utilized. These counters play a pivotal role by tracking the input clock's rising and falling edges, respectively. They count up to `NUM_DIV - 1`, ensuring that each counter tracks one half of the complete division cycle.
- An intricate part of the design involves managing two intermediary signals, `clk_div1` and `clk_div2`. These signals are generated by toggling their states upon the counter reaching half the value of `NUM_DIV`. `clk_div1` and `clk_div2` are responsible for handling the positive and negative transitions of the input clock signal, providing a synchronized mechanism that supports the odd division requirement.
- Eventually, the primary output signal, `clk_div`, is obtained through a logical OR operation between `clk_div1` and `clk_div2`. This synthesis ensures that the divided frequency includes contributions from both the positive and negative clock edges, maintaining balance and continuity in the output signal's waveform.

The challenge presents an opportunity to delve into the nuanced aspects of Verilog coding, encouraging an in-depth exploration of parameterized modules and effective handling of clock division mechanisms, all while accounting for operational precision and robustness in various digital applications.
