Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a top-tier hardware design firm, renowned for its cutting-edge technology and innovation. In your current role, you have been entrusted with the responsibility of developing a crucial Verilog module for a forthcoming high-performance product. The success of this product heavily depends on the flawless functioning of this specific module, which in turn plays a fundamental role in sustaining and even enhancing your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

Given this backdrop, you are provided with a module named `my_dff`, which represents a D-type flip-flop featuring two inputs labelled `clk` and `d`, as well as an output designated `q`. Your task involves creating a chain of three such D flip-flops to construct a shift register with a total length of three. Each flip-flop in the sequence must pass its output `q` to the subsequent flip-flop as the input `d`, ensuring seamless data flow from the first to the third in the sequence.

An important aspect of this task is that the `clk` input, representing the clock signal, must be connected consistently across all instances of the `my_dff` module. This requires ensuring that all three D flip-flops are synchronized and operate in unison under the same clock signal, thereby maintaining the integrity and timing accuracy of the shift register.

Your goals include not just implementing the instantiation of these three D flip-flops, but also carefully wiring them together to achieve the desired shift register functionality within the confines of the provided module skeleton:

```verilog
module my_dff ( input clk, input d, output q );

module top_module ( input clk, input d, output q );
    //Insert your code here
endmodule
```

Reflect on how to effectively instantiate and chain the `my_dff` modules, ensuring that the `clk` input is correctly propagated to each flip-flop, and the data flow from input `d` to output `q` through the shift register is accurately represented.
