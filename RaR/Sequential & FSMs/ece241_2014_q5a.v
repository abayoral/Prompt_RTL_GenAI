You are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company with a solid reputation for innovation and quality in computer hardware. Your current project involves developing a critical Verilog module for an upcoming next-generation product, which is essential for sustaining and enhancing your company's reputation within the highly competitive industry.

Your task is to create a one-input one-output serial Moore state machine in Verilog, designed specifically to compute the 2's complement of an input data stream. The input (x) is delivered as a series of bits, each received per clock cycle, starting from the least-significant bit of the binary number. The module's output (Z) should continuously provide the 2's complement of the bits fed into the input, producing the output in real-time as each bit is processed.

Importantly, the state machine must be robust enough to handle input numbers of any length, as the bit stream size is not fixed or predetermined. A key feature of your design should be the ability to handle an asynchronous reset signal. The conversion process is triggered once the reset signal (areset) is deactivated (released), allowing the machine to begin operation. Conversely, the process must halt whenever the reset signal is asserted, effectively resetting the system's state, readying it for a new sequence whenever needed.

Given this outline, your module's implementation should be housed within the provided top_module interface, ensuring that the necessary clock input (clk), asynchronous reset input (areset), and the serial input (x) and output (z) are correctly wired and functioning as intended. This meticulous design will demonstrate your depth of understanding in digital systems and your ability to contribute significantly to your company's strategic technological advancements.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input x,
    output z
); 

	// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

How would you approach creating this continuously operating serial 2's complement Moore state machine, considering the above requirements?
