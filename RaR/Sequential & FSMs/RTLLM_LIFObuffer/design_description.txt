As a seasoned Verilog designer, consider the challenge of creating a highly efficient and reliable Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer module tailored for transient data storage purposes. This LIFO buffer must be adept at handling data entries with a width of 4 bits and able to store up to four such data entries, ensuring effective management of data through standard push and pop operations. The core operational functions of this buffer—reading and writing—are to be precisely synchronized using control signals aimed at maintaining seamless data flow.

**Module Designation**:  
- The module should be formally identified as `LIFObuffer`, clearly indicating its purpose and functionality.

**Input Signals**:
- `dataIn [3:0]`: A crucial 4-bit input bus tasked with receiving data that is intended to be pushed to the stack's topmost level, effectively serving as the primary input for data writing operations.
- `RW`: The Read/Write control signal, which plays an essential role in determining the buffer's operational mode. When this signal holds a value of '1', it signifies a popping operation (read), and when it holds a value of '0', it indicates a pushing operation (write) of data into the buffer.
- `EN`: The Enable signal, a pivotal component that actively determines when buffer operations can be initiated, preventing unauthorized or spurious operations when it is not asserted.
- `Rst`: A Reset signal that is active-high, used deliberately to reset the buffer's contents and settings, ensuring a clean start and returning all buffer entries to a default state.
- `Clk`: The Clock signal, fundamental to the buffer's synchronization process, ensuring that all state changes occur in lockstep with the system's clock cycles.

**Output Indicators**:
- `EMPTY`: A status flag designed to clearly indicate when the buffer is completely devoid of stored data, suggesting that no valid pop operation can proceed at this point.
- `FULL`: A status flag used to signify the buffer's maximum storage state, indicating that no further pushes can be performed until space is made available by popping data.
- `dataOut [3:0]`: A 4-bit output bus responsible for delivering data that has been popped from the top of the stack, serving as the read data output bus.

**Implementation Overview**:
- At the core of the buffer is a stack memory array, known as `stack_mem`, organized to hold 4-bit entries and designed to operate under LIFO principles, where the concept of adding and removing data is managed in reverse order of arrival.
- A stack pointer (`SP`) orchestrates the stack's current position management, essential for the precise execution of push and pop operations.
- On each rising edge of the `Clk` signal, assuming the `EN` signal is asserted, the buffer examines the conditions imposed by the reset and read/write control signals to define the next operational sequence:
  - If `Rst` is asserted (active-high), the operation enforces an immediate reset, clearing the stack memory of all data and repositioning the stack pointer to reflect an empty stack (e.g., the pointer may be set to indicate a completely unused stack space when empty).
  - With `Rst` inactive, the buffer evaluates its current state to decide on operations:
    - A push command (when RW is low) prompts data insertion from `dataIn` into the stack if space permits (i.e., the stack isn't full), concurrently decrementing the stack pointer to reflect this change accurately.
    - A pop command (when RW is high) triggers data retrieval from the stack's top entry to `dataOut`, additionally clearing the specific memory location used previously, while the stack pointer increments to mark the removal.
  - The `EMPTY` and `FULL` flags require dynamic updates based on the stack pointer's current position and state, ensuring they accurately convey the buffer's availability for further operations.

In essence, undertaking the implementation of this LIFO buffer within Verilog will require a meticulous definition of components, a logical sequencing of stack operations, and updating flag statuses according to the module's precise specifications.
