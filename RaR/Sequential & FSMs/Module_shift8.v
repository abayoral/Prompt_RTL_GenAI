As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the crucial task of developing a Verilog module for a state-of-the-art product. The success of this module is vital for upholding the esteemed reputation of your computer hardware company within the industry. Your task involves working with a given module, `my_dff8`, which contains two inputs and one output and is designed to implement a set of eight D flip-flops.

Your objective is to instantiate three instances of the `my_dff8` module. Following this, you will need to arrange these instances in a sequential manner to form an 8-bit wide shift register that is three D flip-flops long. This configuration will allow you to effectively manage data flow and implement the necessary logic for the product in development.

Additionally, you must design a 4-to-1 multiplexer that is not provided, which will allow you to select the appropriate data output based on a 2-bit selection input `sel[1:0]`. The multiplexer should be configured to output one of four possible values based on the `sel` input: the original input `d`, the output after the first D flip-flop, the output after the second D flip-flop, or the output after the third D flip-flop. This setup means that by controlling the `sel` input, you can select the number of clock cycles by which the input is delayed, with choices ranging from zero to a delay of three clock cycles.

The existing module provided to you for this purpose is as follows:

```verilog
module my_dff8 ( input clk, input [7:0] d, output [7:0] q );
    // Internal implementation of D flip-flops
endmodule
```

Your task is to complete the top-level module:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input clk, 
    input [7:0] d, 
    input [1:0] sel, 
    output [7:0] q 
);
    // Implement your logic here to instantiate the my_dff8 modules,
    // chain them into a shift register, and construct the multiplexer.
endmodule
```

Consider exploring possible methods for multiplexer implementation, such as using an always block with a case statement, to achieve the desired functionality.
