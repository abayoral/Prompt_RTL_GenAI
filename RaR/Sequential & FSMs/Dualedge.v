As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, you have been entrusted with the responsibility of developing a vital Verilog module for an upcoming generation of products. The functionality and reliability of this module are crucial for preserving and enhancing your company's esteemed reputation in the highly competitive computer hardware industry.

In your professional experience, you are well-acquainted with the concept of flip-flops, specifically those that are sensitive to clock edges. Typically, flip-flops are designed to be activated either on the positive edge or the negative edge of a clock signal. However, the challenge presented to you is to implement a flip-flop that can respond to both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. This is commonly referred to as a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

One significant hurdle is the limitation inherent in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which do not natively support dual-edge triggered flip-flops. Due to this limitation, using `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` as a sensitivity list in your Verilog module is not permissible.

The task posed to you is to construct a circuit that delivers the performance and behavior akin to a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using the available resources. The method involves designing separate positive-edge triggered and negative-edge triggered components and orchestrating them to achieve the desired dual-edge response.

Considerations for tackling this challenge may include conceptualizing a schematic or drawing a sketch manually before translating the design into Verilog code. Although the problem can be classified as moderately complex within circuit design, it primarily engages basic features of the Verilog language rather than delving into advanced coding techniques.

Your assignment is to fill in the logic within the Verilog module template provided, ensuring that the resulting circuit accomplishes the functional behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop in the context of FPGA constraints.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output q
);

	// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

In summary, the goal is to creatively design a module that simulates the effect of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, navigating around the FPGA's native limitations by employing a strategy that integrates standard flip-flop designs.
