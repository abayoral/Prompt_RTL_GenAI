As a highly experienced Digital Design Engineer at a renowned hardware design company, you are entrusted with a pivotal project: developing a crucial Verilog module for an upcoming, cutting-edge product. The performance and reliability of this module are vital to your organization, as it directly impacts the company's standing and reputation in the competitive hardware design industry.

The module you need to create implements Rule 110, a fascinating one-dimensional cellular automaton recognized for its complex behavior and mathematical significance, including being Turing-complete. In Rule 110, you are dealing with a linear array of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states - 'on' (represented by 1) or 'off' (represented by 0). At every discrete time step, the state of each cell evolves based on its current state and the states of its immediate neighbors (the cell to its left and the cell to its right), according to a specific rule table provided:

- When the left, center, and right cells are all 1, the center's next state is 0.
- If the left and center cells are 1 and the right cell is 0, the next state is 1.
- For a cell configuration of 1, 0, and 1, the next state is 1.
- A configuration of 1, 0, and 0 results in a next state of 0.
- Similarly, configurations of 0, 1, 1 and 0, 1, 0 both yield a next state of 1.
- If the configuration is 0, 0, 1, the next state is 1.
- Finally, a configuration where all three cells are 0 results in a next state of 0.

Your task is to design a system using Verilog that consists of 512 cells (indexed from 0 to 511), which should progress one time step forward for each clock cycle. A special feature of this system is the 'load' input, which, when activated, should load the system with a designated initial state stored in a 512-bit input array (data[511:0]).

Notably, your system needs to account for boundary conditions, where it is assumed that cells outside the range of 0 to 511 are always in the 'off' state (i.e., q[-1] and q[512] both equate to 0). This implies that the first and last cells would only consider their existing and one neighboring cell when evaluating their next state.

To assist with understanding how the system should operate from an initial condition, consider an example where all starting cells are 'off', except for the first cell (q[0]) which is 'on'. The evolution of the system through the first few iterations follows a specific pattern which can aid in developing validation tests for your module. 

In summary, the main challenge is to write Verilog code for a module that accurately simulates this automaton's behavior, carefully considering updates at each time step and the ability to handle new initial states via a load mechanism, ensuring robustness and compliance with Rule 110's defined logic for cellular state transitions.
