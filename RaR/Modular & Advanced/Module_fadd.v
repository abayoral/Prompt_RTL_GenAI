As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a renowned hardware design company, you are entrusted with the responsibility of creating a highly important Verilog module integral to the development of a cutting-edge product. The module you're required to develop plays a crucial role in upholding your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive computer hardware industry. 

The task involves utilizing a given 16-bit adder, known as the `add16` module, which you will use as a building block to construct a more complex 32-bit adder. This 32-bit adder is to be realized by instantiating two `add16` modules, each of which will handle a portion of the 32-bit addition: one `add16` module will process the lower 16 bits, and the other will manage the upper 16 bits. Notably, this 32-bit adder design excludes the need to consider carry-in for the overall operation (assumed to be 0) or carry-out (which can be disregarded after completion). 

Below is the given declaration for the `add16` module, which performs the operation using internal components and interacts with inputs and outputs as follows:

```verilog
module add16 ( 
    input [15:0] a, 
    input [15:0] b, 
    input cin, 
    output [15:0] sum, 
    output cout 
);
```

Within the `add16` module, it incorporates 16 instances of another essential module, a 1-bit full adder called `add1`. Your additional responsibility is to construct this `add1` module, with its specification provided here:

```verilog
module add1 ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input cin, 
    output sum, 
    output cout 
);
```

A full adder, such as `add1`, is designed to compute both the sum and carry-out for the equation a + b + cin, where `cin` represents the carry-in logic bit, typically propagated from a previous lower bit calculation in a cascading series of full adders otherwise known as a ripple carry adder.

In summary, you are tasked with completing the design using three critical Verilog modules:

1. **`top_module`**: This is your primary top-level module in which you will integrate two `add16` modules to achieve the overall 32-bit adder functionality. It takes as input two 32-bit wide signals and outputs their summed result as a 32-bit wide signal.

2. **`add16`**: A pre-defined 16-bit adder module provided to you for use, which you need to connect appropriately within the top-level module.

3. **`add1`**: A 1-bit full adder module that you are tasked with developing. Please note that failing to define this module will result in a compilation error, specifically indicating that an undefined entity "add1" is being instantiated.

Your objective is to write the necessary Verilog code within the `top_module`, connecting and instantiating each component appropriately to achieve the intended 32-bit addition task without the incorporation of an initial carry-in or attention towards the final carry-out. The external inputs and outputs for `top_module` must reflect the expected design, encapsulating the efficient use of the provided and developed modules.
