You have recently assumed the role of a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prestigious hardware design company renowned for its innovative solutions in the market. You are currently engaged in a crucial projectâ€”tasked with the development of a Verilog module destined to be a significant component of an upcoming next-generation product. The performance and reliability of this module are critical, as its success will have a direct impact on your company's standing and reputation within the competitive realm of computer hardware design.

Your specific task is to implement a 3-bit binary ripple-carry adder using Verilog. This involves creating three instances of a full-adder module to construct the ripple-carry adder, which will be responsible for adding two 3-bit binary numbers together with an additional carry-in input. The resultant output should include a 3-bit sum and a final carry-out signal. Moreover, in order to emphasize the importance of instantiating individual full adders in your design, it is necessary to also derive and display the carry-out from each full-adder within the ripple-carry framework. To clarify, the second index of the carry-out array (cout[2]) should represent the ultimate carry-out signal generated by the last full-adder, essentially serving as the typical carry-out viewers would anticipate.

Given this context, how would you approach the design of the 'top_module' in Verilog to fulfill these requirements? Consider your plan for structuring the module, the instantiation of the full-adders, and handling of input and output signals to ensure that all operational aspects are properly covered.
