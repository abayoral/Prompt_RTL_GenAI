Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a high-profile hardware design company. Your current project involves developing a crucial Verilog module that will be integral to a forthcoming product, one that has been projected to significantly influence the reputation of your company within the highly competitive technology industry. 

As part of your responsibility, you have been assigned to integrate an existing component, referred to as `mod_a`, into your design. This component has two output ports and four input ports, and the specific sequence of the ports is crucial to the successful implementation of the top-level design. The task requires you to correctly connect these six ports from `mod_a` to corresponding ports in your top-level module. The ports in your top-level module are labeled as follows: `out1`, `out2` for the outputs, and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` for the inputs.

Here is the information provided about `mod_a` for context:

```verilog
module mod_a ( output, output, input, input, input, input );
```

And here is the top-level module for which you need to make the connections:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Your challenge is to determine how to connect the ports of `mod_a` to those of `top_module` purely by position, without altering the order or directionality specified. The order of connection must strictly adhere to the positions as described. 

Consider all potential nuances or special considerations that might arise during this implementation, such as register instantiation within the module if necessary, ensuring logical data flow, and maintaining signal integrity. Focus on understanding the synthesis and practical considerations for FPGA or ASIC implementation given the proximity to high-stakes production deadlines and strategic market releases expected by your company.
