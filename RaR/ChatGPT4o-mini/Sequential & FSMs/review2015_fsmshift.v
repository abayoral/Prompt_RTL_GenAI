Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design firm, where your expertise is crucial for the development of cutting-edge technologies. You have been given a pivotal responsibility: to design a Verilog module that serves as a crucial component of a next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is not only a technical challenge but is also vital for upholding your companyâ€™s esteemed reputation in the competitive industry of computer hardware.

In the context of this project, you are specifically focused on designing a Finite State Machine (FSM) that will manage the enabling of a shift register. Your task is to ensure that the shift register can be activated for a precise duration of four clock cycles, triggered by the detection of a specific bit pattern. Furthermore, it is also required that, upon the resetting of the FSM, the system should assert an enable signal (shift_ena) for a total of four cycles, after which this signal should permanently revert to zero until the next reset occurs.

Given this scenario, please consider the following details as you clarify the requirements for this FSM design: 

1. What specific sequence of states and transitions does the FSM need to incorporate in order to effectively recognize the required bit pattern and respond by enabling the shift register for exactly four clock cycles?
2. In what manner will the FSM handle synchronous resets in conjunction with the enable signal? Is there a need for any specific timing considerations or constraints that must be adhered to while managing the enable signal?
3. What should be the operating conditions for the system when the shift register is actively engaged, and how will these conditions influence the design choices made within the FSM?
4. Are there any additional constraints or specifications that the FSM must meet to ensure reliability and performance within the overall architecture of the module?

Your insights and design decisions in response to these inquiries will play an instrumental role in creating a robust and effective FSM for controlling the shift register in this critical module. Please provide a comprehensive outline of how you envision addressing these requirements without including any specific solutions or implementations at this stage.
