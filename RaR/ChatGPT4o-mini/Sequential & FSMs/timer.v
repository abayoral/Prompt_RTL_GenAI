Imagine you are in the position of a senior Digital Design Engineer working for a leading company in the hardware design sector. You have been assigned the important task of developing a Verilog module that plays a critical role in the functionality of a next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is crucial for upholding your company’s esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

The specific requirement for this Verilog module is to create a timer that performs a countdown based on a specified number of clock cycles. Once this countdown reaches zero, it must assert a signal to indicate that the designated duration has completed. A sound approach to achieve this is through the use of a down-counter design, which will activate an output signal, referred to as 'tc' (terminal count), when the counter decrements to zero.

The operation of the timer is synchronized with the clock cycles, and it functions according to the following conditions: 

1. When the input signal `load` is asserted to be 1 (high), the timer should take the 10-bit `data` input and load it directly into an internal counter. This counter will represent the number of clock cycles remaining for the timer to complete its countdown. Notably, this loading process can occur at any point, allowing for flexibility even while the timer is currently counting down.

2. Conversely, when the `load` signal is not asserted (set to 0), the internal counter must decrement its value by one with each clock cycle that passes.

3. The output signal `tc` is crucial as it indicates the status of the internal counter. Specifically, it should assert a high state when the internal counter reaches zero and remain in that state to indicate that the countdown has ceased, effectively stopping any further counting until a new value is loaded into the counter.

With these functionalities in mind, you are tasked with implementing the Verilog code for the module, encapsulating the logical structure required to meet these operational specifications. How would you go about designing and coding this timer module in Verilog, ensuring that all the requirements articulated are meticulously addressed? What design decisions and coding practices would you consider to ensure robustness and efficiency in the module’s functionality?
