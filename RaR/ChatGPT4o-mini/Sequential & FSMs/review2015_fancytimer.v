As a senior Digital Design Engineer responsible for the development of a critical Verilog module for a next-generation product at a leading hardware design company, I have been tasked with designing and implementing a timer functionality that is fundamental to our computer hardwareâ€™s reputation in the industry. 

The goal is to create a timer with a specific operational sequence driven by a single input. This timer must initiate in response to detecting a precise input pattern: the binary sequence 1101. Upon recognition of this pattern, the module must then shift in an additional 4 bits of data that represent the desired duration for the timer delay. This 4-bit input, referred to as delay[3:0], will determine how long the timer counts.

The operational flow of this timer involves several critical steps. Firstly, after the pattern 1101 is detected, the state machine must assert that it is indeed in a counting mode. The counting mechanism needs to operate for a calculated duration, specifically for (delay[3:0] + 1) multiplied by 1000 clock cycles. It is important to note that if the delay value is set to 0, the timer should count for 1000 cycles, while a delay value of 5 would mean a count of 6000 cycles.

During this counting phase, it will be essential to keep track of the current remaining time, adjusting this output to reflect the decreasing value of delay over time. The output should convey the current countdown, beginning with the full delay for 1000 cycles, decrementing by 1 for each subsequent cycle until it reaches zero, at which point it should hold at 0 for another 1000 cycles.

After the counting is completed, the module must assert a 'done' signal to indicate that the timer has expired. At this juncture, the module will wait for a user acknowledgment signal, designated as input ack, which should be set to 1 before resetting the entire system. This reset will then prepare the circuit to detect the next occurrence of the start signal (1101) by returning to the initial state.

It is important to consider the structural organization of the Verilog code for this module. While it is permissible to consolidate all relevant code within a single module, it is critical that each component of the design is managed within their designated always blocks. This separation will enhance clarity and readability, ensuring that future maintenance and debugging can be performed with ease. Care must be taken to avoid merging multiple always blocks, as this can lead to confusion and increase the risk of errors.

Given these guidelines and operational requirements, can you detail how you would approach the design of this Verilog module? Specifically, what considerations would you take into account in terms of state machine implementation, timing accuracy, and overall structure of the code?
