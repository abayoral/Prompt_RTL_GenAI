As a senior Digital Design Engineer working for a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the critical task of developing a Verilog module that is crucial for the advancement of an innovative product in your company’s lineup. The performance and reliability of this module are essential not only for the success of the current project but also for upholding your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

In light of this, your design challenge revolves around processing an 8-bit vector. Specifically, your objective is to identify transitions within this vector where each bit changes from 0 to 1 between clock cycles — an operation analogous to positive edge detection. To accomplish this, the design must ensure that the output bit is set to 1 in the cycle immediately following a detected transition from 0 to 1. 

Given these requirements, your task is to articulate the implementation details of this functionality within the context of a Verilog module, all while adhering to best practices in digital design. How would you approach the problem of detecting the positive edge transitions for each bit in the 8-bit vector? What considerations should be taken into account to ensure that the design is both efficient and robust, particularly considering the performance requirements of the next-generation product? 

Please specify the architecture of your module and elaborate on the mechanisms you would employ to ensure that the output accurately reflects the transitions detected in the input signal.
