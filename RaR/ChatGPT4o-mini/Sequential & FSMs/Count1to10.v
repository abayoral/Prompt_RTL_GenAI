As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent company specializing in hardware design, you have been assigned a significant task involving the creation of a Verilog module that plays an essential role in the development of a next-generation product. The performance and functionality of this specific module are critical, as they will directly impact your organizationâ€™s reputation and standing within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry, which is known for its rapid advancements and high standards.

The objective of this task is to design a decade counter that effectively counts from 1 to 10, inclusive. This means that when the counter reaches the maximum value of 10, it should not roll over to 0 but instead maintain the count of 10 until a reset occurs. The implementation of the reset functionality is crucial; it needs to be a synchronous reset, meaning that the counter will only reset to the value of 1 when triggered by the reset signal during a clock cycle. 

To outline your requirements clearly, you need to focus on defining the module parameters, including the clock input (`clk`), the synchronous reset input (`reset`), and the output (`q`) which will represent the current value of the counter in a 4-bit format. It is essential to ensure that the design adheres to digital design best practices while maintaining reliability and efficiency.

Can you provide a detailed description of how you would approach the design of this decade counter in Verilog, taking into consideration the specific requirements for counting from 1 to 10, the behavior of the synchronous reset functionality, and any potential challenges or considerations that may arise during the implementation process?
