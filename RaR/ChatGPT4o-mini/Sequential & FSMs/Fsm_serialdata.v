As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have the critical responsibility of creating a Verilog module essential for a next-generation product. The importance of this module cannot be overstated, as its successful implementation is vital to upholding your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive hardware industry.

Your task involves the development of a finite state machine (FSM) designed to monitor a stream of bits and determine when bytes have been accurately received. Specifically, the FSM's function includes detecting a start bit, waiting for the transmission of all eight data bits, and then validating the presence of a stop bit. It's essential that the FSM remains vigilant; if the expected stop bit is not detected in a timely manner, it should pause and await its arrival before proceeding with the reception of the next byte.

You now have a finite state machine capable of accurately identifying when bytes are received correctly within the serial bitstream. The next phase of development requires you to integrate a datapath for this module. This datapath must be engineered to output the data byte that has been correctly received. The crucial signal, `out_byte`, should only be valid when the `done` signal is high (1), indicating the successful completion of the byte reception process. When `done` is low (0), the validity of `out_byte` is not specified, implying that it can be in any state.

It is important to consider that the serialization protocol implemented for this design transmits the least significant bit (LSB) first. To facilitate proper data acquisition, the serial bitstream must be shifted in one bit at a time, and subsequently, these bits need to be read out in parallel format to form the complete byte. 

Given this context, carefully outline the specific steps and components you plan to include in the implementation of the datapath. Discuss how you will ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data as it is processed through the finite state machine, leading up to the point where the complete byte is outputted after confirmation of a successful transmission.
