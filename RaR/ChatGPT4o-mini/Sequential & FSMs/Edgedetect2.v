As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned an important task: to develop a Verilog module that is integral to a next-generation product. The successful execution of this module is crucial not only for its functional performance but also for upholding and enhancing your company's standing within the competitive landscape of computer hardware.

The specific challenge at hand involves designing a system that can accurately monitor an 8-bit vector input. The required functionality is to detect any change in the input signal (both rising and falling edges) from one clock cycle to the next. Particularly, you need to implement a feature where the output bits reflect these changes: if there is a transition from a '0' to a '1', the corresponding output bit should be activated in the clock cycle immediately following the transition.

Given this context, you are tasked with outlining your approach to creating the Verilog module `top_module`, which takes two parameters: an input clock signal and an 8-bit input vector. It will produce an 8-bit output vector that indicates the detection of these input signal transitions.

What considerations and methodologies are you planning to apply in the development of this module? Furthermore, could you elaborate on the architecture you envision for accurately capturing these edge transitions, ensuring that the output behavior meets the specified requirements while adhering to best practices in digital design? Please provide insight into the logic and structure of your proposed implementation, as well as any potential challenges you foresee in achieving the desired functionality.
