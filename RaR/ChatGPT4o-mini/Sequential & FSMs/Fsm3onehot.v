As a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been assigned the crucial task of developing a Verilog module that is essential for the performance of an upcoming product. The functionality and effectiveness of this module are vital not only for the product itself but also for upholding the company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

To successfully realize this module, you are presented with a specific challenge: you need to analyze and derive the state transition and output logic equations for a Moore state machine characterized by one input, one output, and a total of four possible states. The states are required to utilize a one-hot encoding scheme, which is defined as follows: State A as 4'b0001, State B as 4'b0010, State C as 4'b0100, and State D as 4'b1000.

Your primary objective is to carefully examine the provided state transition table, which details how the state machine transitions between states based on the input value. You need to identify the next state the machine should transition to for each current state depending on whether the input is 0 or 1, while also specifying the corresponding output for each state. Notably, you must focus on designing the combinational logic that governs both the state transition and output logic, strictly adhering to the one-hot encoding convention.

The state transition table is as follows, detailing the current state, the next state based on the input, and the resulting output:

- For State A:
  - If input = 0, next state = A, output = 0
  - If input = 1, next state = B, output = 0
- For State B:
  - If input = 0, next state = C, output = 0
  - If input = 1, next state = B, output = 0
- For State C:
  - If input = 0, next state = A, output = 0
  - If input = 1, next state = D, output = 0
- For State D:
  - If input = 0, next state = C, output = 0
  - If input = 1, next state = B, output = 1

As part of your implementation in Verilog, you will need to create a module named "top_module" that accepts an input signal, a 4-bit state representation, and outputs both the next state and the output signal. Inside the module, you must declare the parameters for each state and derive the necessary assignments in your code.

In your task, you will be deriving the state transition logic equations by a careful inspection of the state transitions outlined in the table, focusing solely on the combinational logic aspect of the state machine. Your implementation should not incorporate any sequential logic for the state transitions as the provided testbench is designed to validate your outcomes with input states that do not conform to the one-hot encoding.

Overall, you are called to demonstrate your expertise in digital design by crafting the required combinational logic based on the given state transition table, enabling a functional and efficient representation of the Moore state machine's behavior while maintaining the strict adherence to one-hot encoding.
