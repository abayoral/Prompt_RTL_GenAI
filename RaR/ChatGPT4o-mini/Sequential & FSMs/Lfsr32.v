You are in the position of a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and you have been assigned the responsibility of developing an essential Verilog module for a cutting-edge product. The performance and functionality of this module are crucial, as they directly impact your company's reputation within the competitive landscape of computer hardware. 

The task at hand involves the construction of a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which requires careful consideration of the design parameters and specifications. Specifically, your goal is to implement this LFSR with feedback taps placed at specific bit positions: namely, at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. This detail is key as it influences the behavior and characteristics of the LFSR, which serves important functions like pseudo-random number generation or error detection in digital communication systems.

In light of the complexity and size of this module, it is advised to utilize vectors instead of creating individual instances of D flip-flops (DFFs) for each of the 32 bits. This approach not only streamlines the design process but also enhances readability and maintainability of the code.

With this context, please design a Verilog module titled "top_module" that includes the following inputs and outputs:
- An input signal named "clk" that serves as the clock input for synchronizing operations. 
- An input signal named "reset", which is active-high and is intended to reset the LFSR to the value of 32'h1 synchronously with the clock.
- An output bus named "q" that delivers the current state of the 32-bit LFSR.

The structure of the module is already outlined, but it is your responsibility to fill in the operational details and implement the necessary logic to fulfill the design requirements. How would you approach this task, considering the specifications and constraints provided?
