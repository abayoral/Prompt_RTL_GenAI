As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the important task of developing a crucial Verilog module for an innovative product that is set to redefine industry standards. The successful execution of this module is essential not only for the product’s functionality but also for preserving your company's esteemed reputation in the computer hardware domain.

Your project involves designing a specific type of state machine: a one-input, one-output serial two's complementer that follows the Moore state machine architecture. To clarify, the input (referred to as 'x') will consist of a stream of bits fed to the system one at a time with each clock cycle, starting with the least significant bit of the number that needs to be complemented. The output (designated as 'Z') must represent the two's complement of the input bits received.

Importantly, the system must be capable of handling input numbers of arbitrary lengths, meaning that it should be adaptable to accept inputs of various sizes without predetermined limits. Additionally, the design calls for an asynchronous reset functionality, implying that the state machine should be able to reset regardless of the clock state. The conversion process for obtaining the two's complement will start when the asynchronous reset (denoted as 'Reset') is released and will cease when the reset is asserted.

The following is a template for the module, where you are expected to fill in the necessary Verilog code to meet these specifications:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input x,
    output z
); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

In this context, could you elaborate on the specific design considerations and state transitions that should be taken into account for implementing the two’s complement operation within the constraints provided? What factors will influence the design of the state machine and how it processes the input data? Additionally, how will the handling of the asynchronous reset impact the overall functionality of the module during operation?
