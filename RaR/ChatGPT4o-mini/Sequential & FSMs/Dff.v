As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the significant responsibility of developing a crucial Verilog module for an upcoming generation of products. The successful execution of this module is vital for upholding the reputation and credibility of your company within the competitive landscape of computer hardware.

Your task is to create a single D flip-flop module, which is a fundamental building block in digital circuits. This specific module should be capable of capturing and storing a bit of input data on the rising edge of a clock signal. 

In this context, could you please clarify the requirements and best practices for implementing this D flip-flop in Verilog? Specifically, what are the essential features that should be included in the module declaration? How should the input clock and data signals be handled, and what type of signal assignment should be used within the always block to ensure proper behavior during clock edges? Additionally, what considerations should be made regarding the timing and synthesis of this module to ensure it meets performance criteria and reliability standards in a real-world application? Please elaborate on these points while refraining from providing specific coding solutions.
