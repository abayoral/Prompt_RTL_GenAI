As a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been assigned the important task of creating a Verilog module that functions as a decade counter. This module is a crucial component for a next-generation product that your team is developing, and its performance will have significant implications for the company's standing in the competitive computer hardware market.

The key requirements for the design include implementing a decade counter that accurately counts from 0 to 9. The counter should have a total counting period of 10, meaning it must reset to 0 after reaching 9. Additionally, it is essential that the reset mechanism for this counter is synchronous, indicating that the reset signal will only take effect in alignment with the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset input is activated (high), the counter should immediately return to zero.

With these specifications in mind, could you elaborate on how to approach the development of this Verilog module? What design considerations and strategies should be taken into account to ensure that the counter functions reliably and efficiently, particularly in the context of synchronous operation and the management of state transitions? What particular features or mechanisms do you think would be beneficial in providing robustness and accuracy to the counting process?
