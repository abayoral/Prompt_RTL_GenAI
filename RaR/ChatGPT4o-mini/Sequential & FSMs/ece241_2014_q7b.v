As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you are facing a critical challenge involving the design of a vital Verilog module for a next-generation product. The performance and effectiveness of this module are instrumental in safeguarding your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

The task at hand involves generating a One Hertz signal from a 1000 Hertz clock input, which will serve as the enabling signal for a series of hour/minute/second counters, essentially functioning as the backbone of a digital wall clock. Given that the design must ensure the clock ticks precisely once per second, it is crucial that this One Hertz signal is activated for exactly one complete cycle each second.

To achieve this, you are required to implement a frequency divider using a series of modulo-10 binary-coded decimal (BCD) counters, while striving to minimize the number of additional logic gates employed in the circuit. In addition to producing the One Hertz output, your design must also provide enable signals from each of the BCD counters utilized in the module. Specifically, you need to ensure that the output signals are correctly labeled, with `c_enable[0]` corresponding to the fastest counter and `c_enable[2]` denoting the slowest.

To facilitate this process, you have access to a predefined BCD counter module, which operates under the parameters of a high enable signal to initiate counting, and includes a synchronous reset feature that, when set high, resets the counter to zero. In the context of your design under the encompassing `top_module`, you will orchestrate the integration of this BCD counter in conjunction with the specified clock signal at 1000 Hertz and the necessary reset mechanisms.

Given these specifications, how will you structure the connections and logic within your Verilog module to effectively derive the One Hertz signal while ensuring that all counters function utilizing the common 1000 Hz clock input? What considerations will you take into account to ensure optimal performance while meeting the stated requirements for enabling signals?
