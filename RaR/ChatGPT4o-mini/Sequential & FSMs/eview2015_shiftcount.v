As a Senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company, you have been given the critical responsibility of designing a Verilog module for a next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is not just a technical requirement but also crucial for preserving the company’s esteemed reputation within the highly competitive computer hardware industry.

The task at hand is to create a four-bit shift register that concurrently functions as a down counter. Specifically, the design must accommodate a shifting operation, where data is introduced into the register starting from the most significant bit whenever the 'shift_ena' signal is asserted (set to 1). In parallel, the module is also expected to decrement the value currently stored in the shift register each time the 'count_ena' signal is enabled (set to 1). Given that the full system is designed such that both 'shift_ena' and 'count_ena' are never activated simultaneously, the particulars of the module’s behavior in that rare circumstance—where both control inputs are asserted—are inconsequential. This detail implies that it is not necessary to prioritize one operation over the other when both are activated, as the design logic should remain robust under the stated operational constraints.

In the context of these requirements, could you articulate a comprehensive approach to the design of this Verilog module? How would you structure and implement the internal workings of the module to ensure that it performs the desired shift and count operations under the designated control signals? What considerations would you need to take into account to maintain the integrity and performance of the design, while also adhering to best practices in digital design? Additionally, what specific functionality and features would you include in your implementation to make it both efficient and reliable for integration into the overall system?
