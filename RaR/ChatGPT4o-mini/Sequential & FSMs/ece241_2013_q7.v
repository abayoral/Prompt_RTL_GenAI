As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been entrusted with the crucial task of creating a Verilog module that will serve as a JK flip-flop for an upcoming, next-generation product. This task is particularly significant as the success of the module is essential for sustaining your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of computer hardware development.

The JK flip-flop operates according to a specific truth table, which outlines its behavior based on the inputs J and K as well as its current output state, labeled Qold. The truth table provided indicates how Q, the output of the flip-flop, should respond under various combinations of the inputs J and K. More specifically, it shows that:

- When both inputs J and K are low (0), the output Q remains unchanged (retaining the prior state Qold).
- If input J is low (0) while input K is high (1), the output Q resets to low (0).
- Conversely, if input J is high (1) and K is low (0), the output Q sets to high (1).
- Lastly, when both inputs J and K are high (1), the output Q toggles to the opposite of its previous state (inverting Qold).

Given these specifications, your task is to design the JK flip-flop using only a D-type flip-flop combined with logic gates. It is important to note that the state of Qold represents the output of the D flip-flop right before the rising edge of the clock signal.

In this context, could you elaborate on the most effective way to implement the JK flip-flop architecture using the outlined constraints? Additionally, how might you structure the Verilog code inside the module named "top_module," taking into consideration the requirements of the clock signal, the J and K inputs, and the final output Q? Please share your thought process and any relevant details that can contribute to the successful design of this critical component.
