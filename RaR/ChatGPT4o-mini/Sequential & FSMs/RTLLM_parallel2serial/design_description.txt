As an experienced designer proficient in Verilog, you have been assigned the task of designing a module called `parallel2serial`. The primary function of this module is to execute a parallel-to-serial data conversion process. The conversion involves taking a group of four parallel input bits and transforming them into a serial output sequence, which is accomplished one bit at a time, starting with the most significant bit (MSB) and ending with the least significant bit (LSB). 

In order to effectively develop this module, it is essential to outline the following design requirements and operational specifications:

1. **Module Configuration:**
   - **Input Ports:**
     - The module will include a clock input signal labeled `clk`, which will be crucial for controlling the synchronous operations of the conversion process.
     - A reset signal, termed `rst_n`, which functions as an active-low input to initialize or reset the module. When this signal is at a low level (0), it triggers a reset of the system; conversely, when at a high level (1), the system is considered to be operational and out of the reset state.
     - The parallel data input will be defined through a port named `d`, which consists of 4 bits. This input data is what the module will convert into a serial format.

   - **Output Ports:**
     - The module will output a signal named `valid_out`, which acts as an indicator of the availability of valid serial data. This output will be asserted high (1) when there is valid serial data present and ready to be read or processed.
     - An output port named `dout` will provide the serial output, representing one bit of the converted data during each cycle of the process.

2. **Operational Details:**
   - **Conversion Mechanism:**
     - The conversion process will initiate by assigning the MSB of the 4-bit input signal `d` to the serial output `dout`.
     - Following this initial assignment, the module will continue to output the subsequent bits in order of their significance over the next three clock cycles, transitioning from the second most significant bit down to the least significant bit (LSB).
     - A counter, referred to by the variable name `cnt`, will be integral to the operation; it will keep track of the current position within the 4-bit series being processed. This counter will ensure that the appropriate bit is sent to the output `dout` in accordance with the cycle count.

   - **Valid Signal Logic:**
     - The logic for the `valid_out` signal stipulates that it will be set to a high state (1) when a valid bit is present on the `dout`. This condition is initiated at the time the MSB is output and continues to be held through until all bits of the input have been processed, which spans four clock cycles.
     - Once the counter reaches a value of 3, indicating that all four bits have been successfully processed, it will reset to zero. During this entirety of the bit output sequence, the `valid_out` signal will remain high, confirming that valid serial data exists.

3. **Counter and Reset Behavior:**
   - The operational function of the counter (`cnt`) is inextricably linked to the reset signal. When `rst_n` is maintained in a high state, this counter will facilitate cycling through values from 0 to 3, each representing which specific bit from `d` is currently being processed and outputted.
   - If the reset condition is triggered (i.e., when `rst_n` is asserted low), all internal components of the module, including the counter, should be reinitialized to predetermined states, effectively preparing the system to handle new incoming data.

With this comprehensive outline of the specified requirements and functionalities, the focus should be on conceptualizing an appropriate structure for the Verilog code that adheres closely to these design considerations. How might you approach the creation of such a design within Verilog, ensuring all aspects are accounted for as specified?
