As a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been assigned a crucial project involving the development of a Verilog module that plays a significant role in a next-generation product. This particular module is essential not only for the functionality of the product itself but also for safeguarding your company's standing and reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Your primary objective is to create a 4-digit BCD (binary-coded decimal) counter. In this design, each decimal digit will be represented using a 4-bit binary encoding system, where the rightmost four bits (q[3:0]) correspond to the 'ones' digit, the next four bits (q[7:4]) represent the 'tens' digit, and so forth. An important requirement is that for the digits representing hundreds, tens, and thousands (specifically, q[7:4], q[11:8], and q[15:12]), you must also generate an enable signal. This signal will indicate when it is appropriate for each of these upper three digits to be incremented.

In the provided module structure, you have a clock signal (clk) and a reset signal (reset), which is synchronous and active-high. The output includes an enable signal array (ena) for the upper three digits and a 16-bit output (q) that captures the full range of the counter's state.

Could you elaborate on the key design considerations you must take into account when building this 4-digit BCD counter? Specifically, what are the challenges surrounding the synchronization of the enable signals with the clock, the handling of the reset condition, and ensuring that the BCD counting logic correctly wraps around at the appropriate limit for each digit? Additionally, how might you approach the instantiation or modification of one-digit decade counters to achieve the desired functionality? Please provide insights on these aspects.
