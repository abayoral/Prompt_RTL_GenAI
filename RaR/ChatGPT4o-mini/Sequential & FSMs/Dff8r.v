As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you are entrusted with the important responsibility of developing a Verilog module that plays a crucial role in a next-generation product. This module is essential for ensuring that the company maintains its esteemed reputation in the competitive field of computer hardware design. 

Your task involves designing an arrangement of eight D flip-flops, which should be configured to utilize an active high synchronous reset feature. It is critical that all of these flip-flops respond to the positive edge of the clock signal. 

To facilitate this process, you are working with a Verilog module outlined as follows. The module, titled "top_module," includes inputs for the clock (clk), a synchronous reset (reset), and an 8-bit input data bus (d). In addition, there is an 8-bit output bus (q) that will hold the results from the D flip-flops.

Given this context, the specific question arises: How would you go about implementing the necessary hardware logic to define and instantiate eight D flip-flops within the confines of this module, ensuring that they are correctly configured for active high synchronous reset behavior and are properly synchronized with the positive edge of the clock signal? 

Please elaborate on the approach, techniques, and considerations you would take into account when writing the associated Verilog code to accomplish this design objective, while also keeping in mind the key requirements and constraints associated with such a critical component in a next-generation product.
