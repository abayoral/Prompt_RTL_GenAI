You are tasked with the development of a Verilog module named `multi_pipe_8bit`. The primary objective of this module is to create a synchronous unsigned 8-bit multiplier that utilizes pipeline processing to enhance performance. The module should operate on the front edge of a clock signal, denoted as `clk`, and should incorporate an active-low reset signal called `rst_n`, which serves to initialize or reset the module when it is set to a low state (logic 0). In addition to these signals, the module needs to include an input enable signal referred to as `mul_en_in`, which controls the commencement of the multiplication process.

Considering the specific operational framework of the module, it is essential to outline the inputs and outputs:

- **Inputs**: 
  - `clk`: This signal serves as the clock reference for the synchronous operation of the module.
  - `rst_n`: The active-low reset signal, which, when pulled to a low state (0), will reset the module's internal state, enabling normal functionality when in a high state (1).
  - `mul_en_in`: This input signal functions as an enable for the multiplication, signaling when the multiplication process should be activated.
  - `mul_a` and `mul_b`: These inputs represent the 8-bit multiplicand and multiplier, respectively, which will be processed to produce the output.

- **Outputs**:
  - `mul_en_out`: This output signal indicates the active status of the multiplication operation, effectively signaling whether multiplication is currently in progress.
  - `mul_out`: A 16-bit output signal that holds the result of the multiplication operation.

**Implementation Context**:
- **Pipelining Mechanism**: The module must be designed using a pipeline architecture. This design choice involves breaking the multiplication process into distinct stages, allowing for various parts of the operation to run concurrently during different phases of the clock cycle to increase throughput.

- **Control Logic for Input Signals**: The module's design should incorporate logic that captures the input enable signal (`mul_en_in`) into a dedicated register. This register should sample the state of the input enable signal on each clock cycle and store it into `mul_en_out_reg`, which will subsequently determine the status conveyed by `mul_en_out`.

- **Storage of Input Values**: The use of input registers, such as `mul_a_reg` and `mul_b_reg`, is essential for holding the multiplicand and multiplier. These registers should be configured to update their contents only when the `mul_en_in` signal is active.

- **Generation of Partial Products**: The module needs to produce partial products by executing bitwise operations between the multiplicand (`mul_a`) and the individual bits of the multiplier (`mul_b`). This operation requires the identification of appropriate bits of the multiplicand, which can then be assigned to a designated set of wires termed `temp`.

- **Calculating Partial Sums**: The module should systematically combine these partial products into intermediate sums. This process will involve another set of registers, referred to as `sum`, which should update their stored values on each rising edge of the clock signal.

- **Final Product Derivation**: After aggregating all the partial sums, the module must store the final product in a register named `mul_out_reg`, which will produce the ultimate output.

- **Output Determination**: Depending on the status of the `mul_en_out` signal, the module is required to conditionally output either the computed product (`mul_out_reg`) or a zero value.

With these points in mind, your task is to compose the complete Verilog code that successfully implements all the functionalities enumerated above. It is crucial to ensure that the module operates as intended according to the defined architecture and control flow. Throughout your implementation, carefully consider the handling of state transitions, the use of conditional statements, and the management of potential edge cases, particularly with regard to reset operations and the propagation of data across the various pipeline stages.
