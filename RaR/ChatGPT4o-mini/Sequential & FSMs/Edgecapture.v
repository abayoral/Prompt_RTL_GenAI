As a senior Digital Design Engineer working for a prominently recognized hardware design company, you have been assigned the crucial task of developing a Verilog module that is considered essential for a next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is not just about technical achievement; it is also critical for sustaining the esteemed reputation your company holds within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry. 

The module in question must effectively monitor a 32-bit vector input and capture transitions of its individual bits in a very specific manner. Specifically, the requirement entails detecting when any given bit in the 32-bit input vector transitions from a state of 1 during one clock cycle to a state of 0 in the subsequent clock cycle. The term "capture" in this context signifies that once a transition is detected, the corresponding output bit should be set to 1 and remain in this state until the output is reset. This reset must be controlled through a synchronous mechanism—a reset signal that, when activated, will reset the output bits to 0 at the next positive edge of the clock.

Additionally, the behavior of each output bit should emulate that of an SR (Set-Reset) flip-flop with specific precedence rules. The output bit should be set to 1 during the clock cycle following the detected 1 to 0 transition. However, if a reset signal is simultaneously triggered during this event, priority must be given to the reset action, which means the output must revert to 0 regardless of the set condition. 

To further clarify, one significant aspect of the implementation involves handling potential conflicts that might arise when both conditions—the detection of a transition from 1 to 0 and the reset signal being active—occur in the same clock cycle. A detailed analysis of timing is required to ensure that the reset condition is appropriately prioritized over the setting condition, and this must be clearly illustrated in your design through careful timing considerations.

Given this context, how would you approach the design of the Verilog module to meet these requirements while adhering to best practices in digital design? What specific coding strategies or structures would you employ to ensure the module functions correctly according to the criteria laid out, particularly in managing the synchronous reset and the bit transition capturing mechanism?
