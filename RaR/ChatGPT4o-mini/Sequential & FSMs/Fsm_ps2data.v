Let's consider a scenario in which you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working for a prominent hardware design company that specializes in computer hardware products. You have been assigned a critical task: the development of a Verilog module that will play a crucial role in a next-generation product. The performance of this module is not just important but vital for upholding the company's esteemed reputation within the competitive hardware industry.

The task involves interpreting messages from a PS/2 mouse protocol, which transmits data in packets composed of three bytes each. A challenge arises due to the continuous nature of the byte stream, where it is not immediately clear where the boundaries of each message are located. The protocol stipulates that the first byte of each message will have its fourth bit (representing bit[3]) set to 1. However, it is important to note that the same does not apply to the subsequent bytes, where bit[3] can either be 1 or 0, depending on the data being transmitted.

To effectively address this challenge, the goal is to design a finite state machine (FSM) that can accurately detect the start and end of these three-byte messages within the uninterrupted byte stream. The approach is straightforward: the FSM will ignore incoming bytes until it encounters one that has bit[3] equal to 1. Upon detecting such a byte, the FSM will recognize it as the first byte of a new message and will confirm the completion of a message once the subsequent two bytes have also been received, thereby signaling the receipt of a full three-byte packet.

Now that you have developed the finite state machine capable of identifying and parsing three-byte messages contained within the PS/2 byte stream, your next step is to enhance this system by introducing a datapath component. This additional functionality is intended to output the entire 24-bit message as soon as a complete packet is successfully received. Specifically, the first byte of the message should be represented by the 8 bits of out_bytes[23:16], while the second and third bytes should correspond to out_bytes[15:8] and out_bytes[7:0], respectively.

It is critical that the out_bytes output is valid only at the moment when the done signal is asserted, which indicates that a complete message has been received. At all other times, the output of out_bytes can be regarded as “don't care,” meaning it can display any value without impacting system functionality.

Now, the task is encapsulated in a Verilog module defined as follows: 

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [23:0] out_bytes,
    output done); //

    // Insert your code below
    
    // FSM from PS/2 packet parser

    // New: Datapath to store incoming bytes.

endmodule
```

Given this information, how can you clarify and elaborate on the process of integrating the datapath to ensure that the module not only identifies the three-byte messages but also captures and outputs those messages correctly when the done signal is asserted? What are the considerations, design decisions, and methodologies you might take into account while implementing this addition in your Verilog module?
