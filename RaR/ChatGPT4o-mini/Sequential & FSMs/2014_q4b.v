As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you are currently entrusted with the critical task of developing a pivotal Verilog module for an upcoming next-generation product. This module's performance is essential to ensuring that your company maintains its esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry. 

Given this context, you are required to create a top-level Verilog module, designated as `top_module`, specifically for implementing a shift register with a predetermined configuration where the register size is set to four bits (n = 4). 

In the implementation of `top_module`, you must instantiate four instances of a predefined subcircuit called `MUXDFF`. This subcircuit serves a vital role in achieving the desired functionality of the shift register. 

Furthermore, you need to consider the input and output connections for this module based on a physical implementation on the DE2 development board. Specifically, the R inputs of your shift register should be connected to the SW switches available on the board. The clock signal, indicated as `clk`, will be connected to the first KEY button, labeled as KEY[0]. The Enable signal, referred to as `E`, should be wired to KEY[1]. The Load signal, denoted as `L`, is to be connected to KEY[2]. Lastly, the write signal, represented as `w`, should interface with KEY[3]. 

In terms of output, the results from the shift register need to be displayed through the red LEDs, which correspond to the pins labeled LEDR[3:0].

With this understanding, your task is to construct the structural framework of the `top_module` in the provided code template, ensuring that it aligns with the specified requirements and integrates the necessary subcircuit instances effectively. As you embark on this design task, please focus solely on the construction of the module without elaborating on specific implementation details or solutions.
