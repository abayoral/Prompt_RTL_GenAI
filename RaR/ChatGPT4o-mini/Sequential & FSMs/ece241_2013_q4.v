Consider your role as a highly experienced Digital Design Engineer at a prominent company in the hardware design sector. You have been presented with the important responsibility of creating a Verilog module that is integral to the functionality of an upcoming product. The robustness of this module is crucial, as it directly affects your company's standing and reputation within the competitive landscape of computer hardware manufacturing.

The foundational concept of this module revolves around managing a large water reservoir that provides essential service to its users. In order to maintain appropriate water levels, three sensors are strategically positioned at 5-inch vertical intervals. The system is designed to operate based on specific thresholds determined by the readings of these sensors. For example, if the water level exceeds the highest sensor, designated as S_3, the system should halt the input flow rate entirely. Conversely, when the water level drops below the lowest sensor, labeled S_1, the system should maximize the flow rate by opening both the nominal flow valve and the supplemental flow valve.

Within the range defined by the positions of the sensors, the system's flow rate is not arbitrary; it is governed by the current water level and the level recorded prior to any changes in sensor status. Each water level is associated with a predetermined nominal flow rate, essential for maintaining optimal reservoir conditions. Should a sensor change indicate an increase in water level over the preceding sensor, the system is required to establish the nominal flow rate. In contrast, if the previous level was higher than the current level, the design must incorporate a mechanism to enhance the flow rate by activating the supplemental flow valve, which is influenced by a parameter termed delta FR.

Your task now entails designing a Moore finite state machine (FSM) that will effectively regulate the water reservoir controller. It is imperative that you specify all potential state transitions along with the corresponding outputs for each state. The inputs to this state machine encompass the readings from the sensors S_1, S_2, and S_3. Meanwhile, the outputs include flow rates FR1, FR2, and FR3, in addition to the delta FR parameter.

Furthermore, the design must incorporate a synchronous reset feature that, when activated, resets the state machine to a condition that simulates a prolonged low water level scenario. In this reset state, no sensors should register input, and all four output signals should be activated.

Given these requirements, how would you approach the design of this Verilog module? Specifically, what state machine architecture would you propose, how would you delineate the transitions based on the sensor inputs, and what output configurations would reflect the operational logic of the water level management system? Please outline your thoughts on this design challenge without providing explicit solutions or code implementations.
