As a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you've been given the important responsibility of creating a vital Verilog module that will serve as a D flip-flop for a cutting-edge product that the company is developing. This module is not just any component; its performance and reliability are crucial because they directly impact the credibility and standing of the company within a highly competitive industry. 

In light of this task, could you elaborate on how you would go about implementing a D flip-flop using the Verilog hardware description language? Specifically, please consider the requirements for the module, including the handling of clock signals and data input while ensuring proper functionality of the output. Additionally, could you discuss any design considerations, best practices, or potential challenges that may arise during the implementation process? Your insights into how you would approach writing the Verilog code for this flip-flop will be invaluable, given the module's significance in the overall performance of the product.
