As a lead Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you're at the forefront of creating a pivotal Verilog module intended for a next-generation product offering. The performance and reliability of this module are crucial for upholding your company's esteemed standing within the competitive landscape of computer hardware development.

You are tasked with the design of a timer that adheres to a series of specific operational requirements:

1. **Pattern Detection:** The timer should initially activate upon the recognition of a distinct binary pattern, specifically "1101."
  
2. **Bit Shifting for Delay Duration:** Following the detection of this pattern, the module should shift in an additional 4 bits to ascertain the duration for the timer delay. This step is essential for determining how long the timer will run based on the subsequent bit input.

3. **Countdown Synchronization:** Once the delay duration is established, the module must engage in a countdown process. This countdown is contingent upon a separate input signal indicating that the counting process has concluded.

4. **User Notification:** After the countdown is complete, the system needs to notify the user that the timer has expired. This notification must be conveyed through a specific output signal.

5. **User Acknowledgment:** The system should then enter a wait state, remaining in this state until the user acknowledges the completion of the timer by asserting an acknowledgment signal.

6. **State Reset for New Detection:** Upon receiving the necessary acknowledgment, the state machine must reset itself to the initial state, allowing it to resume monitoring for the next occurrence of the predefined start sequence "1101."

In this context, you are specifically developing only the finite-state machine (FSM) responsible for controlling the timer, rather than the complete data pathway, which will include counters and comparators necessary for the timer's operation.

The serial data input will be available through the designated data input pin. It is essential that when the state machine detects the "1101" pattern, it asserts the output signal `shift_ena` for a precisely defined duration of four clock cycles. At this point, the status of the timer shifting operation is expected to transition to its counting process, indicated by asserting an output signal that signifies the module is now waiting for a high signal from `done_counting`. 

Upon receiving this signal, the state machine should then assert the output `done` to alert the user that the timer has reached its timeout. Finally, it will await a high signal on the `ack` input before resetting itself, thereby effectively re-entering the searching state for the next "1101" sequence.

Given this elaborate context, can you detail the design considerations and the distinct states that the finite-state machine should encompass to facilitate these requirements? Additionally, what synthesis constraints or considerations must be taken into account during the implementation to ensure both functionality and reliability of the timer module?
