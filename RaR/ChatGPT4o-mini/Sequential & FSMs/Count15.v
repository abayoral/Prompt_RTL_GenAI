As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, I am faced with an important task involving the development of a Verilog module that is crucial for a next-generation product. This project holds significant importance not only for the functionality of the product itself but also for the overall reputation of our company within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

The design I need to implement is a 4-bit binary counter, which should effectively count from 0 to 15 and then reset back to 0. The counter must operate on a period of 16, meaning it should cycle through the numbers 0 to 15 inclusively. Additionally, itâ€™s required that the reset mechanism for the counter is synchronous, specifically an active-high signal that brings the counter back to zero whenever reset is activated.

With this context in mind, I would like to clarify the specifications for the Verilog module that I need to construct. Can you elaborate on the requirements for this 4-bit binary counter module? Specifically, I am interested in understanding the expected behavior of the counter during normal operation, the exact functionality of the synchronous reset feature, and any additional design considerations that may be pertinent to ensure the module meets both performance standards and reliability expectations within the scope of the project's timeline. 

Here is an outline of the module framework I have so far:

```
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,      // Synchronous active-high reset
    output [3:0] q);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Could we discuss what elements should be included in the code to fulfill the given requirements and any best practices that should be followed during the development process?
