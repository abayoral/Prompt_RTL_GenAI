As a senior Digital Design Engineer at your esteemed hardware design company, you have been entrusted with a critical assignment: to develop a specific Verilog module that plays a crucial role in the functionality of a next-generation product. This module is not just another component; its successful implementation is vital for upholding the reputation of your company in the competitive landscape of computer hardware.

The task at hand involves creating a two-bit saturating counter with distinct operational characteristics. The counter must be designed to increment its value, up to a maximum of 3, under the condition that both inputs `train_valid` and `train_taken` are asserted (equivalent to 1). In contrast, the counter is required to decrement its value, down to a minimum of 0, when `train_valid` remains asserted but `train_taken` is deasserted (i.e., set to 0).

Moreover, it is important to consider the scenario where training is inactive; in this case, indicated by `train_valid` being deasserted (0), the counter's value should remain unchanged and not be affected by any further signals.

An additional requirement is that the counter must feature an asynchronous reset input, denoted as `areset`. When activated, this input should reset the counter to an initial state of weakly not-taken, specifically represented as 2'b01.

The output of this module, which is represented by the signal `state[1:0]`, will reflect the current value of the two-bit counter. 

Given this context, how would you go about designing and implementing this two-bit saturating counter module in Verilog, considering all the provided specifications and operational requirements?
