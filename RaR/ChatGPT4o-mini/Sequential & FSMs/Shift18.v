You hold the position of a senior Digital IC Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, and you have been given the critical responsibility of creating a Verilog module for an upcoming, next-generation product. This module is essential not just for the functionality of the product, but it also plays a crucial role in upholding your company’s reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Your task is to design a 64-bit arithmetic shift register that incorporates synchronous loading capabilities. This shift register must have the ability to perform shifts in both the left and right directions, with the specific shift amount being selectable—allowing for shifts of either 1 bit or 8 bits, as determined by the input signal.

It is essential to understand that the arithmetic right shift function should distinguish itself from a logical right shift by shifting in the sign bit from the most significant bit (the 63rd bit) of the register, rather than zero, thus preserving the number's sign and effectively simulating the division of signed numbers by powers of two. In contrast, it is important to note that there is no functional difference between logical and arithmetic left shifts.

The module should utilize specific inputs to determine its operational mode: 
- The `load` input should initiate a loading process, filling the shift register with data from a 64-bit input (`data[63:0]`) when activated, rather than performing a shifting operation.
- The `ena` signal controls whether or not a shift operation occurs.
- The `amount` input will dictate the nature of the shift and the direction: 
    - A value of `2'b00` will indicate a left shift by 1 bit,
    - `2'b01` will signify a left shift by 8 bits,
    - `2'b10` indicates a right shift by 1 bit,
    - and `2'b11` denotes a right shift by 8 bits.
- Finally, the output `q` should reflect the current contents of the shift register post-operation.

To illustrate the difference between arithmetic and logical shifting, consider a 5-bit binary number: If it is `11000`, an arithmetic right shift by 1 results in `11100`, contrasting with a logical shift, which would yield `01100`. Conversely, for the non-negative binary number `01000`, an arithmetic right shift by 1 results in `00100`, which is identical to the result of a logical right shift, underlining the distinction in operation based on the signed nature of the value.

With all these requirements and characteristics outlined, what strategies or design considerations should be kept in mind while developing this Verilog module? How can we ensure the shift register performs reliably under specified conditions and accurately handles both arithmetic and logical shifts, maintaining efficiency and correctness throughout its operations?
