As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent company specializing in hardware design, you have been given the responsibility of creating a crucial Verilog module that will be instrumental in the development of a next-generation product. This specific module—an implementation of a D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset feature—is vital for ensuring the overall success of the product, which in turn plays a significant role in preserving your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive hardware industry.

With that context in mind, could you elaborate on the necessary considerations and steps required to successfully implement the D flip-flop within the provided module framework? Specifically, what should be taken into account regarding the input signals, the behavior of the flip-flop under normal operation versus when the asynchronous reset is activated, and the desired characteristics of the output signal? Additionally, how might you structure the code to ensure both clarity and functionality, considering potential edge cases or industry best practices? As you construct your design, what advanced techniques or methodologies might you utilize to enhance reliability and performance, especially in a high-stakes environment where the module's performance could significantly impact both the product and the company's standing in the marketplace?
