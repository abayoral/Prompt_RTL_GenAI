As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the critical responsibility of developing a Verilog module that plays a significant role in a next-generation product. This specific module is a D flip-flop, which is essential for the functionality of the product, and its successful implementation is vital for upholding your company's established reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Your task requires you to create a Verilog implementation of this D flip-flop, keeping in mind that it functions as a latch. Consequently, you should be prepared for potential warnings that Quartus may issue, specifically regarding the inference of a latch instead of a flip-flop, as the design may exhibit latch-like behavior under certain conditions.

With this context in mind, could you elaborate on the specific design requirements and constraints for this D flip-flop? Additionally, what considerations should be taken into account about the input signals, 'd' and 'ena,' and how should they interact with the output 'q'? Furthermore, what are the implications of the Quartus tool's warning regarding latch inference, and how might this affect the overall design strategy and implementation process? Please provide clarifications on these aspects to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the project requirements.
