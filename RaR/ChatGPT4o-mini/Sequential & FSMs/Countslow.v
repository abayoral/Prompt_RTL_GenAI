As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been assigned the responsibility of creating a vital Verilog module for an upcoming product that is integral to your companyâ€™s standing in the competitive hardware industry. For this task, you are required to design a decade counter, which is a digital circuit that counts from 0 to 9, returning to 0 after reaching its maximum value, cycling through this range continuously. 

The specific requirements for this decade counter design include the following elements: 

1. The counter must count inclusively from 0 to 9, which means that it should count a total of 10 discrete states over a full cycle.
2. The counter should operate with a reset input that is synchronous; this means that when the reset signal is triggered, the counter will revert to 0 in sync with the clock signal, rather than asynchronously.
3. Additionally, there is a need for a control signal, labeled as 'slowena', which will allow the counter to have the flexibility to either increment its count or remain paused. When the slowena signal is active, the counter should be enabled to increment its value; when it is inactive, the counter should hold its last value and not change.
4. The module is expected to have a structure that is clear and efficient, following best practices in digital design.

With these specifications in mind, could you articulate how you would structure the Verilog code to accomplish these tasks efficiently? Moreover, please elaborate on the key considerations you would keep in mind while implementing the functionality and the timing aspects of the counter mechanism, as well as any potential challenges you might anticipate in ensuring the counter operates correctly under various conditions.
