As an expert in Verilog design, consider the task of creating a module intended for a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer that is specifically designed to facilitate temporary data storage operations. The focus of this design is on developing a LIFO buffer that supports data entries with a width of 4 bits, capable of holding up to four such entries, which will enable efficient data operations characterized by the fundamental actions of pushing and popping data.

### Key Aspects of the Design

**Module Title**:  
What would you name this module to accurately reflect its functionality and purpose? For instance, the module is to be referred to as `LIFObuffer`.

### Input Signal Specifications:
1. **`dataIn [3:0]`**: It functions as a 4-bit input bus that allows the transfer of data that will be pushed onto the top of the buffer. In terms of its role, how does the data input facilitate the write operation?
2. **`RW`**: This control signal directs the buffer to execute a read or write operation. Can you elaborate on how this signal distinguishes between the two operations, particularly on what conditions identify a read (high value '1') versus a write (low value '0')?
3. **`EN`**: This is an Enable signal that governs whether the buffer can perform any operations. What should the conditions be for this signal to be asserted, ensuring that actions are only executed under specific circumstances?
4. **`Rst`**: As an active-high Reset signal, how does it ensure that the buffer can be initialized or reinitialized effectively? What specific steps will be taken to clear the entries in the buffer and return the system to its default state upon activation of this signal?
5. **`Clk`**: This Clock signal is pivotal for coordinating synchronous operations within the buffer. How will it influence the timing of all actions taken within the buffer during each clock cycle?

### Output Signal Specifications:
1. **`EMPTY`**: This flag serves as an indicator to reflect the current status of the buffer concerning the absence of stored data. How will this flag be set or cleared based on the buffer’s state?
2. **`FULL`**: Similarly, what conditions or scenarios lead this flag to indicate that the buffer has reached its maximum capacity?
3. **`dataOut [3:0]`**: This 4-bit output bus is responsible for conveying data that is popped from the buffer. In what manner does this output facilitate the read operation, and how is its value determined?

### Implementation Considerations:
In terms of implementation, the core element of this buffer is a stack memory array, often referred to as `stack_mem`. What are the characteristics of this storage structure that would effectively follow the LIFO principles, and how should these characteristics be reflected in the code?

Moreover, how will the stack pointer (`SP`) be utilized to keep track of the current position within the stack, and what design considerations should be taken into account for managing the push and pop operations effectively?

### Operational Protocol:
On each rising edge of the `Clk`, and assuming that `EN` is asserted, how will the buffer determine what actions to take based on the states of the reset, read/write, and other control signals? Specifically, what sequence of checks will be conducted to ensure appropriate operations are performed?

1. When the reset signal is active, how does the module ensure that both the stack memory and the stack pointer are initialized to their defaults?
2. If the reset signal is not active, how does the buffer ascertain whether a push or pop operation should be executed and under what conditions? How does it handle the data flow between the input and output in these operations?
3. In both scenarios, what specific updates to the `EMPTY` and `FULL` flags will be necessary based on the result of the stack pointer's status?

In executing this design in Verilog, what architectural components and logical constructs will be necessary to accommodate the outlined requirements for stack operations, and how will these elements ensure that flag statuses are accurately maintained throughout the buffer’s functioning?
