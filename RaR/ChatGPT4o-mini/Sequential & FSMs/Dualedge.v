As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, you have been assigned the critical responsibility of developing a crucial Verilog module for a next-generation product. The success of this module is vital not only for the functionality of the product but also for preserving your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

Your expertise includes knowledge of various types of flip-flops, such as those that are triggered on the positive edge of a clock signal or those that respond to the negative edge. However, you are faced with a specific challenge: the implementation of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. Such a flip-flop can theoretically capture data on both the rising and falling edges of a clock signal. Nonetheless, you must navigate the constraints of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which do not support dual-edge triggered flip-flops. As a result, the conventional sensitivity list that includes both the positive and negative edges of the clock, represented by the syntax `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)`, is not permitted within FPGA design practices.

With these limitations in mind, your task is to instigate a design that mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop within the confines of FPGA technology. The challenge lies not in the coding complexity but in crafting a suitable circuit design that leverages fundamental features of the Verilog language. It is advisable to begin by sketching the circuit on paper to visualize how to achieve the desired functionality before translating that design into Verilog code.

In light of this context, how would you approach the development of a circuit that functionally simulates the capabilities of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, given the specific constraints and requirements associated with FPGA implementations? Please outline the considerations and steps you would take to successfully design this module while adhering to the engineering and design principles expected at your level of expertise.
