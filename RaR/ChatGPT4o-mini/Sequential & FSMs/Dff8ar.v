Imagine that you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design firm, specifically assigned to the development of a crucial Verilog module intended for a next-generation product launch. Recognizing the importance of this module, it is essential to understand that its functionality is vital not just for the project's success, but also for upholding your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

In this context, you are tasked with designing a specific component: an array of eight D flip-flops (DFFs). These flip-flops must incorporate an active high asynchronous reset feature, meaning that the reset signal should immediately affect the state of the DFFs, regardless of the clock signal. Additionally, it is important to note that these flip-flops should be responsive to the rising edge of a clock signal (clk). 

As you consider the implementation of this module, keep in mind a crucial hint: the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous reset flip-flops lies primarily in how the sensitivity list is defined in your code. This detail is pivotal for ensuring that your design meets the required specifications for asynchronous operation.

With that background, could you clarify how you would approach the coding of this module? Specifically, what structural elements would you include to fulfill the requirements for the eight D flip-flops, their reset functionality, and their triggering mechanism based on the clock signal? Additionally, how might you ensure that the design is both efficient and aligns with industry standards?
