Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company, where you have taken on the significant responsibility of creating an essential Verilog module for an advanced product. The performance and reliability of this module are crucial for preserving the esteemed reputation of your computer hardware organization within the competitive landscape of the industry.

Your task involves enhancing the functionality of a serial receiver by incorporating parity checking into its operation. In particular, you will be implementing odd parity, which necessitates the addition of an extra bit following each data byte. Under this scheme, the total number of 1 bits in the received 9-bit sequence must be odd. For instance, the bit sequence 101001011 is compliant with the odd parity requirement due to its five 1s, in contrast to 001001011, which does not fulfill this condition.

With that foundation laid, your specific instructions are to modify both the finite state machine (FSM) and the accompanying datapath to incorporate this odd parity checking mechanism effectively. You need to ensure that the ‘done’ signal is asserted only when a byte is accurately received and the parity check confirms its validity. The FSM should operate similarly to the existing serial receiver FSM. It must first identify the start bit of incoming data, wait until all 9 bits (which include both the data bits and the parity bit) have been received, and subsequently validate the correctness of the stop bit. If the expected stop bit is missing, the FSM should continue to wait until a valid stop bit is detected before attempting to commence the reception of the next byte.

In addition to these requirements, you are provided with a module named ‘parity’ designed to facilitate the calculation of the parity of the input stream. This module is a toggle flip-flop (TFF) with a reset function, intended to operate on the input bit stream, where it must be reset at appropriate intervals in order to accurately count the number of 1 bits encountered in each byte of data.

Here is the defined module for parity that you will integrate into your design:

```verilog
module parity (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input in,
    output reg odd);

    always @(posedge clk)
        if (reset) odd <= 0;
        else if (in) odd <= ~odd;

endmodule
```

Following this, your focus shifts to the top-level module where you are required to implement your design adjustments:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [7:0] out_byte,
    output done
); //

    // Insert your code below

    // Modify FSM and datapath from Fsm_serialdata

    // New: Add parity checking.

endmodule
```

In summary, your overarching question is: How can you effectively adapt the existing FSM and datapath of the serial receiver to successfully integrate odd parity checking, ensuring that each received byte's integrity is assessed and the ‘done’ signal is only asserted when the byte is both correctly received and validated in accordance with the odd parity rule? What design considerations and logical sequences must be addressed to meet these goals while adhering to the specified communication protocol?
