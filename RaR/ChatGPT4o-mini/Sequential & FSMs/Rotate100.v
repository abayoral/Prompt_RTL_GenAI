As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company, your current assignment involves creating a crucial Verilog module that is essential for a next-generation product. The successful development of this module is vital not only for the product's performance but also for safeguarding your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

The specific task at hand is to design a 100-bit rotator that has the capability to rotate bits to the left or right, with the functionality of synchronous loading and control for the direction of rotation. This rotator must be able to shift bits in such a way that when a bit is moved out from one end, it is reinserted on the opposite end, contrasting with a traditional shifter that simply removes the bits that shift out and fills in with zeros. 

Your module must feature the following characteristics:
- A 'load' control signal that, when activated, allows the rotator to load a new set of data represented as a 100-bit input (data[99:0]), overriding any ongoing rotation process.
- An 'ena' input that is a two-bit signal determining the operational mode of the rotator. Specifically, you need to implement the following behaviors based on the value of 'ena':
  - 2'b01: This should trigger a right rotation by one bit.
  - 2'b10: This should enable a left rotation by one bit.
  - Both 2'b00 and 2'b11 should indicate that no rotation occurs.
- An output, 'q', which will consistently reflect the current state of the rotator's contents, allowing observation of the resultant bit arrangement after operations are performed.

Given these requirements, how would you proceed to implement the Verilog code for this module, ensuring that it adheres to all the aforementioned specifications while also maintaining efficiency and accuracy in processing? Please elaborate on the different components and logic you would consider incorporating into your solution.
