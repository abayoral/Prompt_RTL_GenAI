Imagine you are assigned the responsibility of crafting a digital logic module using Verilog, a widely utilized hardware description language that is instrumental in modeling electronic systems. Your specific objective is to design a module that operates as a 64-bit subtractor, with the added functionality to detect potential overflow situations during the subtraction operation. The module, to be named `sub_64bit`, will need to accept two 64-bit input data lines, which you will label as `A` and `B`. Each of these lines is intended to represent a signed integer value, allowing for the accurate processing of both positive and negative numbers.

The primary computation that your module must perform is the arithmetic subtraction of these two values, represented as `A - B`. To facilitate the proper functioning of this module, you will need to define two main output ports. The first output port, `result`, will be a 64-bit line that captures the difference obtained from subtracting `B` from `A`. The second output port, termed `overflow`, will be a single-bit signal that indicates the presence of an overflow condition during computation.

Understanding how to determine whether an overflow has occurred is critical in this context. You will need to evaluate the sign bits of both input operands as well as the sign of the resultant output. Specifically, an overflow condition can be identified through two scenarios:
1. When a positive number (signed representation) is subtracted from a negative number, resulting in a negative output — this situation is recognized as positive overflow.
2. Conversely, when a negative number is subtracted from a positive number and yields a positive output — this case indicates negative overflow.

Your design must ensure that the overflow signal is set to 1 in the event that either of these overflow conditions is detected, confirming that the resulting value from the subtraction cannot be accurately represented within the confines of 64 bits. If the subtraction operation does not result in an overflow, the overflow signal should be set to 0, signaling that the output can be considered reliable and free of error.

Your task now is to implement this desired functionality within the Verilog environment. This involves not only laying out the actual procedures for performing the subtraction but also developing a robust method for detecting overflow conditions within the complete code representation of the `sub_64bit` module. Careful attention must be paid to the definitions and interactions of input and output signals within your design, as well as ensuring the logical flow for overflow detection is correctly articulated in the Verilog code. Could you outline your approach to developing this module, detailing how you would handle the arithmetic operations and the specified conditions for overflow detection?
