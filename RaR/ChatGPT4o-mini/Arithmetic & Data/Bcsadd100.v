As a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned a critical task involving the development of a Verilog module that plays a significant role in a next-generation product. The successful creation of this module is essential not only for its functional capabilities but also for upholding the esteemed reputation of your company in the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Within this context, you have access to a predefined Verilog module named `bcd_fadd`, which is designed specifically for adding two Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) digits, along with an input carry. This module produces a sum and a carry-out, thereby facilitating the addition of two BCD values and a carry-in signal.

Your task is to scale this functionality significantly by instantiating 100 copies of the `bcd_fadd` module. The goal is to construct a comprehensive 100-digit BCD ripple-carry adder that can add together two large BCD numbers, which are represented as 400-bit vectors, and incorporate a carry-in input. The output should consist of a 100-digit sum along with a carry-out signal. 

To achieve this, consider utilizing constructs such as instance arrays or a generate statement, which can simplify the creation of multiple instances of the `bcd_fadd` module in an efficient and organized manner. 

Can you elaborate on how you would go about implementing this setup? What considerations would you take into account when designing the instantiation of the `bcd_fadd` modules to ensure they function correctly together as a larger system? Additionally, what methods or strategies might be employed to maintain clarity and efficiency in your Verilog code while achieving the required functionality?
