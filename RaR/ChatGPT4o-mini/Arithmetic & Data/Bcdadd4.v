As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you are charged with an important task: developing a crucial Verilog module for an advanced product. This module plays a vital role in maintaining the esteemed reputation of your company within the competitive landscape of computer hardware.

You have access to a pre-existing Verilog module called `bcd_fadd`, which is a one-digit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) adder. This module has the functionality to add two BCD digits alongside a carry-in value, ultimately producing both a sum and a carry-out signal. The associated code for the module `bcd_fadd` specifies its inputs as two 4-bit vectors for the BCD digits (named `a` and `b`) and a single bit for the carry-in (named `cin`), while producing a carry-out (`cout`) and a 4-bit sum.

Your task now is to utilize four instances of the `bcd_fadd` module to construct a 4-digit BCD ripple-carry adder. This newly created adder module will need to operate on two 4-digit BCD numbers, which will be represented as 16-bit vectors input into the top-level module. Furthermore, you are required to account for an incoming carry-in to generate the final outputs: the 4-digit summed outcome and the resulting carry-out.

Additionally, thereâ€™s a pertinent hint provided relating to the representation of a 5-digit decimal number such as 12345, clarifying that its BCD representation is distinctly represented in hexadecimal (20'h12345), as opposed to its decimal representation (14'd12345), which would be interpreted differently in the context of BCD versus binary numbers. This key distinction underlines the fundamental differences in representing numeric values in various coding schemes.

In light of these specifications, you are tasked with inserting the necessary code within the outlined framework of the `top_module`, ensuring that the logic and structure align with that of a traditional binary ripple-carry adder, while adjusting for the base-10 nature of the BCD adders. 

What considerations will you take into account while crafting your implementation to ensure accuracy and efficiency in the operation of this BCD ripple-carry adder? How will you address potential complications relating to carry propagation and digit overflow, given that the sum can result in values exceeding the BCD limits for a single digit? Additionally, how will you effectively organize and instantiate the four `bcd_fadd` modules to manage the addition of the four BCD digits, ensuring that each output correctly reflects the operational requirements stated above?
