I would like to pose a detailed inquiry regarding a specific Verilog design task. The task involves creating a Verilog module called `fixed_point_adder`, which is intended to function as a parameterized fixed-point adder. This module should facilitate arithmetic operations while adhering to a predetermined level of fixed precision. To further elaborate on the requirements, please consider the following aspects that the module should encompass:

1. **Module Nomenclature:**
   - The module should be aptly named `fixed_point_adder`.

2. **Parameter Specifications:**
   - **Q Parameter:** This parameter is pivotal as it dictates the count of bits allocated to the fractional component of the fixed-point representation. The precise determination of `Q` is essential as it influences the precision achievable in arithmetic operations within this adder.
   - **N Parameter:** This parameter establishes the total bit count for each fixed-point number, encompassing both the integer and fractional segments. This ultimately influences the width of the operands and the resultant output, making it crucial for defining the range and representation of the fixed-point values involved.

3. **Input Designations:**
   - **Operand a:** The first operand, designated as `a`, will be represented as a fixed-point number with a width of N bits, indicated as `a [N-1:0]`.
   - **Operand b:** Likewise, the second operand, labeled `b`, will also have a width of N bits and will be represented as `b [N-1:0]`.

4. **Output Designation:**
   - **Result c:** The output of the adder will be captured in the N-bit output port `c`, denoted as `c [N-1:0]`, which will yield the result of adding the two fixed-point operands.

5. **Internal Register Configuration:**
   - **Result Register:** An internal N-bit register named `res`, defined as `res [N-1:0]`, will be employed to temporarily hold the computation's result, whether that be from addition or a conditional subtraction based on the operand values.

6. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - **Addition of Absolute Values:** The module needs to check if the most significant bits (MSBs) of both inputs `a` and `b` are identical, implying they possess the same sign. In this scenario, an absolute value addition process should be executed, with care taken to ensure the resultant sign corresponds to the common sign of the inputs.
   - **Subtraction of Absolute Values:** Conversely, if the MSBs of `a` and `b` are not the same, indicating differing signs, it is necessary for the module to ascertain which operand has a greater absolute value. Based on this comparison, the appropriate subtraction (either `a - b` or `b - a`) should be performed, with the MSB of the result needing to reflect the outcome accurately.
   - **Precision Maintenance:** As fixed-point arithmetic necessitates maintaining precision, it is important that both the operands `a` and `b` align with the defined segments dictated by the `Q` parameter, ensuring accuracy in arithmetic operations.
   - **Overflow Handling:** There must be a provision in the design to address potential overflow instances. The module should actively monitor the MSB to confirm that the results generated remain within the valid N-bit boundaries.

In light of these comprehensive specifications and considerations, I seek guidance on how to construct the appropriate Verilog code to encapsulate all the delineated functionalities.
