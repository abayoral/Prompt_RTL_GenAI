As a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned a crucial task involving the development of a specific Verilog module that will play a vital role in the success of an upcoming next-generation hardware product. This module's effectiveness is not only important for the technical specifications of the product but also for preserving the esteemed reputation of your company within the highly competitive computer hardware industry.

With this context in mind, I would like to delve into the specifics of your task related to the creation of a full adder. A full adder is a fundamental digital circuit that is designed to perform the addition of three binary bits: two primary bits and an additional carry-in bit. The full adder's functionality is to output two key results: the sum of the input bits and a carry-out, which indicates whether the addition exceeds the range of a single bit.

Could you clarify the exact specifications and requirements for designing this full adder module in Verilog? In particular, I am interested in understanding the following aspects:

1. **Input and Output Definitions**: How would you define the inputs (a, b, and cin) and outputs (cout and sum) in terms of their sizes and types within the module?

2. **Functional Requirements**: What are the precise behavioral expectations for the full adder in terms of the logic operations that it must implement to accurately produce the desired outputs based on the provided inputs?

3. **Integration with Larger Systems**: How should this full adder module interface with other components or modules within the larger system? Are there any specific considerations or constraints to keep in mind during the integration process?

4. **Performance Metrics**: Are there performance goals or metrics that this full adder should meet, such as speed, power consumption, or size, that would impact its design?

5. **Testing and Validation**: What strategies will you employ to ensure that this full adder is thoroughly tested and validated before it is deployed in the next-generation product?

By elaborating on these points, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the requirements and challenges you face in creating this fundamental building block of digital circuits, as well as how its success will contribute to the overall objectives of your hardware product.
