As a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a leading hardware design company, you have been entrusted with the critical task of creating a Verilog module that is essential for the success of a next-generation product. This product is of utmost importance, not only for its technological advancements but also for the maintenance of your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive hardware industry.

In this context, consider the scenario where you need to handle two signed 8-bit numbers represented in two's complement format: 'a[7:0]' and 'b[7:0]'. Your objective is to perform an addition operation on these two numbers to generate a result 's[7:0]'. This operation must be executed with precision, as any miscalculation could lead to significant repercussions for product performance and, consequently, the company's standing.

Moreover, you are required to determine if a signed overflow occurs during this addition process. Specifically, an overflow must be tracked when the addition of two positive numbers results in a negative output, or when two negative numbers yield a positive result. To achieve this, you can consider several established techniques for overflow detection. One approach involves analyzing the signs of the input values in conjunction with the output to ascertain the overflow status. Alternatively, you could utilize the carry-out bits from specific bit positions during the addition as a means of determining whether an overflow condition has manifested.

Given these considerations, please construct the Verilog module 'top_module' as per the specified requirements. This module should accept two 8-bit signed integer inputs, perform the addition to produce an 8-bit output, and also calculate an overflow status. You may start implementing your code by outlining how the sum 's' will be derived and how the overflow detection mechanisms will be integrated. 

Ultimately, ensure that your implementation is both robust and efficient, reflecting the high standards expected in cutting-edge hardware design.
