As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been entrusted with the significant responsibility of crafting a crucial Verilog module that will play an essential role in the functionality of an upcoming groundbreaking product. The effective execution and performance of this module are vital, as it directly influences the reputation and standing of your computer hardware company within the competitive industry landscape.

In your current project, you are required to design a half adder, which is a fundamental digital circuit used for binary addition. Specifically, the task is to create a Verilog code segment that defines the behavior and outputs of a half adder. A half adder takes two single-bit binary inputs and generates two outputs: the sum and the carry-out. Importantly, it's worth noting that this operation does not incorporate any carry-in bit, therefore the focus remains solely on the addition of the two input bits.

To encapsulate this, could you please detail how you would approach the implementation of such a half adder in Verilog? Specifically, what considerations and steps would you take to ensure that the module is not only efficient in its execution but also meets the rigorous standards of design quality that is typically expected in your industry? Additionally, how would you structure the module to facilitate proper input and output handling, ensuring clarity and maintainability in the code?
