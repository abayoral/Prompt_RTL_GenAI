As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working at a leading hardware design company, you have been assigned a critical responsibility involving the development of a Verilog module that is essential for the success of a next-generation product. This module holds significant importance, as its performance will have a direct impact on your company's reputation within the competitive computer hardware industry.

Your specific task is to design an adder-subtractor circuit using the existing 16-bit adder module that has been provided to you. This adder module is defined as follows:

```verilog
module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );
```

In your design, you are required to instantiate this 16-bit adder module twice in order to create a final 32-bit adder-subtractor implementation. The challenge lies in ensuring that the module can correctly perform both addition and subtraction based on the value of a control signal, `sub`.

To achieve this, you'll need to utilize a 32-bit XOR gate. The purpose of this XOR gate is to conditionally invert the `b` input when the `sub` signal is set to 1. This inversion can be conceptualized as applying the XOR operation between the 32-bit representation of `b` and the `sub` signal replicated across all bits. Additionally, it is necessary to connect the `sub` input effectively to the carry-in of the adder module in order to handle the subtraction operation accurately.

Given these requirements, you are to outline your approach to embedding your code in the following module structure:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    input sub,
    output [31:0] sum
);

	// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

With this context established, please consider the complexity of the design and any potential challenges you might encounter in implementing the adder-subtractor functionality using the specified components and connections. What steps will you take to ensure that your implementation is both accurate and efficient? How will you address any potential edge cases, such as overflow or edge behavior with negative numbers in the 32-bit representation? Additionally, how might you validate the correctness of your module once it is completed?
