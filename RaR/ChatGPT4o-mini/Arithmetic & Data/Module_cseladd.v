Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a renowned hardware design company, and your current assignment is to create a crucial Verilog module for an advanced product that is set to launch soon. The successful development of this module is essential for upholding your company's standing and reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

In this context, you have been provided with an existing module named `add16`, which is designed to perform the addition of two 16-bit numbers, incorporating a carry-in input and yielding both a 16-bit sum and a carry-out output. Your task involves the instantiation of this `add16` module three times to assemble a carry-select adder. Additionally, you are required to utilize your own design for a 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer in this process.

You are tasked with establishing the connections among these modules as specified in a provided diagram (though the diagram is not included here). The provided module `add16` has the following declaration, which outlines its inputs and outputs:

```verilog
module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );
```

Furthermore, there is a `top_module` where the connections and operations must be defined:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);
```

Given this framework, what specific considerations and strategies would you need to implement in your design to ensure that the carry-select adder functions correctly? Additionally, how do you plan to manage the integration of the `add16` instances and your 2-to-1 multiplexer within the `top_module`? Itâ€™s important to think about aspects such as signal management, timing considerations, and potential edge cases that may arise. How will you ensure the overall robustness and efficiency of the final implementation? Please include all relevant details, focusing on the design and interconnection challenges you anticipate.
