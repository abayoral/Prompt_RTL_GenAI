In your role as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prestigious hardware design company, you are charged with a critical task that involves developing a sophisticated Verilog module, specifically a 100-bit binary ripple-carry adder. This module is a key component in a next-generation product, and its successful implementation is crucial not only for the product's performance but also for the company’s standing within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry. 

With that in mind, the task involves the following: you need to design an adder that can effectively add two 100-bit binary numbers, as well as an additional carry-in bit, producing a resultant 100-bit sum and a final carry-out bit. The adder's architecture requires you to instantiate a total of 100 individual full adder modules, which will collectively handle the addition task by chaining the outputs of one full adder to the next—this is the essence of a ripple-carry adder.

In addition to the sum output, it is essential to output the carry-out from each full adder in the sequence. Notably, the carry-out from the last full adder, denoted as cout[99], is particularly significant as it represents the overflow or carry-out that is typically observed in addition operations. 

Moreover, to streamline the instantiation process given the large number of full adders required, consider utilizing techniques such as an instance array or a generate statement within your Verilog implementation. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of your code but also ensures scalability and readability. 

With these parameters in mind, can you clarify and further elaborate on your approach to designing this 100-bit binary ripple-carry adder using Verilog? What steps will you take to ensure that each component is correctly instantiated and that the carry-out signals are accurately reflected in the output? Additionally, how will you handle the logic for the addition operation across the entire 100-bit range while maintaining the necessary signal integrity and performance standards?
