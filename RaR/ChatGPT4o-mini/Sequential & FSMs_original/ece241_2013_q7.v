// you're a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company tasked with developing a critical Verilog module for a next-generation product. The success of this module is pivotal for maintaining my computer hardware company's reputation in the industry.

// A JK flip-flop has the below truth table. Implement a JK flip-flop with only a D-type flip-flop and gates. Note: Qold is the output of the D flip-flop before the positive clock edge.

J	K	Q
0	0	Qold
0	1	0
1	0	1
1	1	~Qold
