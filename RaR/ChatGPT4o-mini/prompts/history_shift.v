Sure, here is a rephrased and expanded version of the question for greater clarity:

---

Design a module for a 32-bit Global History Shift Register that includes the capability to roll back its state in response to a pipeline flush triggered by a branch misprediction. The module should operate as follows:

1. **Updating the Branch History on Prediction:**
   - When a branch prediction is made, indicated by `predict_valid = 1`, the predicted outcome `predict_taken` should be shifted into the least significant bit (LSB) of the history register. This effectively updates the branch history with the predicted direction of the branch. In this context, `predict_history[0]` represents the direction of the most recent (youngest) branch.

2. **Handling a Branch Misprediction:**
   - When a branch misprediction is detected, indicated by `train_mispredicted = 1`, the history register should be immediately updated to reflect the state after the completion of the mispredicted branch. This involves loading the history register with `train_history`, which represents the history before the mispredicted branch, and concatenating it with the actual outcome `train_taken` of the branch.

3. **Simultaneous Prediction and Misprediction:**
   - If a prediction (`predict_valid = 1`) and a misprediction (`train_mispredicted = 1`) occur simultaneously, the misprediction should take precedence. This is because the pipeline flush resulting from the misprediction will also clear the branch that is currently making the prediction.

4. **Asynchronous Reset:**
   - The module should support an asynchronous reset, activated by setting `areset`. When asserted, this reset should clear the history register, setting it to zero.

5. **Output:**
   - The module should output the current value of the history register via `predict_history`.

The following is the Verilog module template:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input areset,

    input predict_valid,
    input predict_taken,
    output [31:0] predict_history,

    input train_mispredicted,
    input train_taken,
    input [31:0] train_history
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Provide the implementation details for this module in Verilog, ensuring that it handles the described scenarios correctly.
