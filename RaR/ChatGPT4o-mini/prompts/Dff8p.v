Certainly! Here's an expanded version of the question with added detail:

---

Design and implement a digital module in Verilog that consists of 8 D flip-flops. Each flip-flop should have the following characteristics:

1. **Active-High Synchronous Reset**: The reset signal should be active-high and should operate synchronously with the clock. This means that the reset action should occur based on the clock edge.
   
2. **Preset to Specific Value (0x34)**: Upon activation of the reset signal (reset), the 8 flip-flops should not reset to the default value of zero. Instead, they should reset to a specific hexadecimal value, 0x34.

3. **Negative Edge Triggered**: The flip-flops should be sensitive to the negative edge of the clock (clk). This means they should capture the input data (d) on the falling edge of the clock signal.

Here is the partially defined module for you to complete:
```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] q
);

    // Insert your code here to define and connect the 8 D flip-flops

endmodule
```

### Additional Notes:
- Consider using structural or behavioral Verilog to implement the flip-flops.
- Make sure to reference the hint provided: Resetting a register to '1' is sometimes called "preset".
- Your design should ensure that when the reset signal is active, the output `q` of the flip-flops correctly initializes to 0x34.

This should provide enough detail to better understand the requirements and constraints for implementing the module.
