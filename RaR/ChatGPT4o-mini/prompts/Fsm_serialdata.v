To clarify and elaborate on the question, including more context and expanding on the task, here's a detailed rephrased version:

You have an existing finite state machine (FSM) designed to correctly identify and process bytes from a continuous stream of serial bits. In this protocol, each byte is framed by a start bit, 8 data bits (with the least significant bit transmitted first), and a stop bit. The FSM operates as follows:
1. It detects the start bit to initiate the reception of a new byte.
2. It then waits and collects the following 8 data bits sequentially.
3. Finally, it verifies the presence of the stop bit to confirm the completion of the byte reception.

If the expected stop bit is not detected at the correct time, the FSM continues scanning the incoming bitstream until it finds a stop bit, after which it restarts the process of receiving the next byte.

The task now is to enhance this setup by including a datapath mechanism that will store the correctly-received 8-bit data and output it. The output data byte (`out_byte`) must be valid and ready for further processing when a signal (`done`) indicates the completion of a byte reception. If `done` is not asserted, the content of `out_byte` can be considered as don't-care.

Here are the requirements you need to address:
1. Integrate the FSM that handles the detection of start, data, and stop bits.
2. Add a datapath that will sequentially shift in each received bit during the data bit reception phase.
3. Ensure that upon successfully receiving a complete byte (with a correct stop bit), the accumulated 8-bit data is made available on the output (`out_byte`).
4. The `done` signal should be asserted only when a complete byte has been correctly received and verified.

The task involves modifying or extending the provided module template to achieve the above functionality. Note that the serial bits need to be shifted in one at a time and then read out in parallel.

Here is the template for your reference:
```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [7:0] out_byte,
    output done
); 

    // Insert your code below
    
    // Use FSM from Fsm_serial

    // New: Datapath to latch input bits.

endmodule
```

Work on incorporating the FSM logic and implementing the new datapath as per the outlined requirements.
