You have been provided with a module called `add16` which is designed to perform 16-bit addition. The purpose of your task is to create a 32-bit adder by instantiating two of these `add16` modules. Here is the detailed breakdown of the requirements and the structure of your task:

1. **Module Information:**
   - The `add16` module has the following port declaration:
     ```verilog
     module add16 (
         input [15:0] a,
         input [15:0] b,
         input cin,
         output [15:0] sum,
         output cout
     );
     ```
   - This module performs addition on 16-bit operands `a` and `b` with a carry-in `cin`, producing a 16-bit sum (`sum`) and a carry-out (`cout`).

2. **Composition Using add16:**
   - You will use two `add16` modules to perform the full 32-bit addition.
   - The first `add16` module will be responsible for computing the lower 16 bits of the result. It will take the lower 16 bits of the 32-bit inputs and perform the addition.
   - The second `add16` module will handle the upper 16 bits of the result. It will take the upper 16 bits of the 32-bit inputs and will also take the carry-out from the first `add16` module as its carry-in.

3. **Inter-module Connections:**
   - The carry-out (`cout`) from the first `add16` module needs to be connected to the carry-in (`cin`) of the second `add16` module. This ensures the cross-boundary carry is considered in the higher 16 bits addition.

4. **Full Adder Module Requirement:**
   - The `add16` modules internally instantiate 16 full adders (module `add1`) to accomplish the addition.
   - The `add1` module, not provided, has the following declaration:
     ```verilog
     module add1 (
         input a,
         input b,
         input cin,
         output sum,
         output cout
     );
     ```
     Each `add1` module computes the sum and carry-out for a single bit of addition.

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Your 32-bit adder implementation (the top-level module) does not need to handle an external carry-in; assume it to be 0.
   - The carry-out from the overall 32-bit addition can be ignored and does not need to be connected to any output pins.

6. **Top-level Module Overview:**
   - Name: `top_module`
   - Inputs: two 32-bit operands `a` and `b`
   - Output: a 32-bit result `sum`
   - This module will instantiate two `add16` modules and connect them appropriately to achieve the desired functionality.

Here's a scaffold of the top-level module for further elaboration:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
    // Insert your code here to instantiate add16 modules and connect them
);

endmodule
```

Remember to ensure the connections between the lower and upper `add16` modules to handle the carry between the two 16-bit sections correctly.
