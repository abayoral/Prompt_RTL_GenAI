Would you mind creating a module in Verilog that accurately implements the functionality of a NOR gate? For context, a NOR gate is essentially an OR gate whose output is inverted. In terms of logic functions, this means the NOR gate yields a true output only when both inputs are false; in all other cases, it produces a false output. 

To aid in this task, remember that Verilog provides two types of OR operators: the bitwise-OR ('|') and the logical-OR ('||'), much like the C programming language. Given that we're dealing with single-bit inputs here, either operator will suffice for our implementation. 

The module template provided is as follows:
```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out 
    );
    
    // Insert your code here
    
endmodule
```

Please ensure you define the output 'out' such that it accurately reflects the NOR operation based on the provided inputs 'a' and 'b'.
