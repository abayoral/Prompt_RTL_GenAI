To help you better understand and expand on the task, let's break down the given instructions and clarify what you need to do step-by-step:

You are provided with a Karnaugh map (K-map) representation, and your goal is to implement the corresponding digital circuit in Verilog. The K-map for three variables (a, b, c) is given in tabular form where each cell in the map represents a specific combination of the variables, denoted by the corresponding binary values in parentheses.

Here is the K-map given:

|          | a'(0) | a(1) |
|----------|-------|------|
| b'c'(00) | 1     | 1    |
| b'c (01) | 1     | 1    |
| bc (11)  | 1     | 1    |
| bc'(10)  | 1     | 1    |

This means:
- When b = 0 and c = 0 (represented by b'c'), the output is 1 regardless of the value of a.
- When b = 0 and c = 1 (represented by b'c), the output is 1 regardless of the value of a.
- When b = 1 and c = 1 (represented by bc), the output is 1 regardless of the value of a.
- When b = 1 and c = 0 (represented by bc'), the output is 1 regardless of the value of a.

Steps for your task:
1. **Simplify the K-map:** Before coding the circuit, you should attempt to simplify the expression derived from this K-map using Boolean algebra. You can simplify both using the Product-of-Sums (POS) and Sum-of-Products (SOP) methods.
2. **Implement the circuit:** Once you have the simplified Boolean expression, you can translate it into the Verilog code.

**Your main objectives:**
- **Simplification:** Simplify the K-map into a simpler Boolean expression.
  - Use both the Product-of-Sums (POS) method and the Sum-of-Products (SOP) method.
  - Ensure that your simplification is logically equivalent to the original K-map. Although the optimal simplification is not mandatory, itâ€™s crucial that the resulting expressions are correct.
  
- **Implementation:** Translate the simplified Boolean logic expression into Verilog code.
  - Implement the logic inside a Verilog module called `top_module`.
  
Provide the Verilog syntax for this module. The module must:
  - Accept three input signals: a, b, and c.
  - Produce one output signal: out.

```verilog
// Verilog module declaration

module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output out  
); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Feel free to write your Verilog code between the provided comments, ensuring that you've correctly implemented the circuit described by your simplified Boolean expression derived from the K-map.
