Please create a Verilog module named `top_module` that functions as an XNOR gate. Specifically, this module should have two single-bit input signals, `a` and `b`, and produce a single-bit output signal, `out`, which represents the result of the XNOR operation performed on the inputs.

Key points to consider:
- In Verilog, the bitwise-XOR operator is represented by the symbol `^`.
- Verilog does not have a separate logical-XOR operator.
- The XNOR operation is essentially the negation of the XOR operation.

Your task is to write the necessary Verilog code within the module to implement this behavior. The overall structure of the module is provided below, and you need to complete the section marked with "Insert your code here" to define the logic for the XNOR gate.

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out 
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```
