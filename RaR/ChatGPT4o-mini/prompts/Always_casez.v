Sure! Here is an expanded and clarified version of the question:

**Task Description:**

Design and implement a hardware module using Verilog that functions as a priority encoder for 8-bit inputs. A priority encoder is a type of circuit that identifies the position of the highest-priority (or first/least significant) '1' bit in an input vector and outputs the corresponding position. If no bits are set to '1' in the input vector, the output should be zero.

**Details:**

1. **Input:**
   - An 8-bit vector named `in` which can have varying combinations of 0s and 1s.
   
2. **Output:**
   - A 3-bit output named `pos` which indicates the position of the first (least significant) '1' bit in the input vector.
   - If there are no '1' bits in the input vector, the output should be `3'd0`.

**Example:**

- For an input vector of `8'b10010000`, the expected output should be `3'd4`, because the first '1' bit (starting from the least significant bit or rightmost bit) is located at position 4.
- For an input vector of `8'b00000000`, the expected output should be `3'd0`.

**Constraints:**

- Use Verilog 2001 syntax for this implementation.
- The module should be named `top_module`.
- Add the necessary logic within the module to achieve the described functionality.

**Code template to follow:**

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,            // Input: 8-bit vector
    output reg [2:0] pos       // Output: 3-bit position of the first '1' bit
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Ensure that the logic correctly identifies the position of the first '1' bit in the input vector and handles the case where no bits are set to '1'.
