Design a module to implement a multi-functional four-bit shift register with an integrated down counter. The shift register should have the capability to shift data in, most-significant bit (MSB) first, whenever the `shift_ena` signal is activated (set to 1). In addition to this, when the `count_ena` signal is activated (set to 1), the current value contained within the shift register should be decremented by one. It is important to note that the external system, which interacts with this module, will never enable both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` at the same time. Therefore, the module design does not need to address the case where both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are simultaneously activated, meaning the behavior in such a scenario can be left unspecified. 

Please implement this functionality in Verilog within the given module definition:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,          // Clock signal input
    input shift_ena,    // Control signal to enable data shifting
    input count_ena,    // Control signal to enable counting down
    input data,         // Single-bit data input for shifting into the register
    output [3:0] q      // Four-bit output representing the current state of the register
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Key requirements to address:
1. Implement a four-bit shift register.
2. Shift operations should insert the new data bit at the MSB position when `shift_ena` is 1.
3. Decrement the register value by one when `count_ena` is 1.
4. It is acceptable to leave the operation behavior undefined for the condition where both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are simultaneously 1.

Add the necessary logic to ensure the functionality described above within the provided module template.
