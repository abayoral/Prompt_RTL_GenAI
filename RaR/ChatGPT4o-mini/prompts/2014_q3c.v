To further understand and expound on the task of implementing the logic functions for `Y[0]` and `z` using the provided state-assigned table, let's break down the question into more detailed steps and specific requirements.

Given the state transition table below, you are required to implement the logic for `Y[0]` and the output `z`. The provided table outlines how the state transitions depend on the input `x` and also specifies the corresponding output `z` for each state.

### State Transition Table

| Present state `y[2:0]` | Next state `Y[2:0]` when `x=0` | Next state `Y[2:0]` when `x=1` | Output `z` |
| :---------------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------: | :--------: |
|          000            |              000               |              001               |      0     |
|          001            |              001               |              100               |      0     |
|          010            |              010               |              001               |      0     |
|          011            |              001               |              010               |      1     |
|          100            |              011               |              100               |      1     |

### Task Description

**Objective:**
1. Determine the logic functions for the next state `Y[2:0]` based on the current state `y[2:0]` and the input `x`.
2. Implement the output `z` based on the current state `y[2:0]`.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create a module named `top_module`.
- The module should include the following inputs and outputs:
  - `clk`: A clock signal input.
  - `y`: A 3-bit input representing the current state.
  - `x`: A 1-bit input signal.
  - `Y0`: A 1-bit output representing the least significant bit of the next state.
  - `z`: A 1-bit output representing the output associated with each state.

**Module Template:**
```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [2:0] y,
    input x,
    output Y0,
    output z
);

    // Insert your logic implementation here

endmodule
```

### Notes and Considerations:
- **State Representation:** The states are given as 3-bit binary numbers, where each state is identified by `y[2:0]`.
- **Next State Determination:** For each state, you need to evaluate the next state `Y[2:0]` based on the input `x`.
- **Output `z` Calculation:** The output `z` is solely determined by the current state `y[2:0]` and does not depend on the input `x`.

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Define the Logic for Next State `Y0`:**
   - Determine the conditional expressions or combinational logic that can compute `Y0` based on the current state `y[2:0]` and input `x`.

2. **Define the Logic for Output `z`:**
   - Create a logic expression or combinational logic to derive `z` based on the current state `y[2:0]`.

3. **Ensure Proper Integration with the Clock (`clk`):**
   - While the problem does not require state storage (using the clock), make sure your combinational logic is correctly placed and clock synchronization considerations are met if you incorporate sequential logic.

By clarifying these steps and breaking the problem down into these detailed components, you should have a comprehensive understanding of how to approach the implementation of the logic for `Y0` and `z` based on the given state transition table.
