To better understand the function you need to implement, consider the Karnaugh map provided for the function \( f \). The Karnaugh map is organized based on four variables \( x_1, x_2, x_3, \) and \( x_4 \). The table below represents the function \( f \) defined by the inputs in the Karnaugh map:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
     & x_1'x_2' & x_1'x_2 & x_1x_2 & x_1x_2' \\
\hline
x_3'x_4' & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
x_3'x_4  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
x_3x_4   & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
x_3x_4'  & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\]

The goal is to implement a function that satisfies this Karnaugh map in Verilog. Hereâ€™s how you can approach the problem:

1. **Understand the Variables**: Each combination of the variables \( x_1, x_2, x_3, \) and \( x_4 \) corresponds to a specific cell in the Karnaugh map.
2. **Identify the Cell Values**: The value in each cell (either 0 or 1) indicates the output of the function \( f \) for that specific combination of inputs.
3. **Formulate the Logic Expression**: From the Karnaugh map, derive the minimal logic expression for \( f \).
4. **Implement in Verilog**: Finally, write the Verilog code to implement the function using the minimal logic expression you derived.

Your task is to complete the Verilog module `top_module`, where the input `x` is a 4-bit vector corresponding to \( x[4], x[3], x[2], \) and \( x[1] \) respectively, and the output `f` is the function you need to implement. Make sure to account for the ordering of the input bits as described in the Karnaugh map.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [4:1] x,
    output f
); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Recall that:

- \( x[4] \) corresponds to \( x_4 \)
- \( x[3] \) corresponds to \( x_3 \)
- \( x[2] \) corresponds to \( x_2 \)
- \( x[1] \) corresponds to \( x_1 \)

Use these mappings to derive the correct logical expression for the function \( f \).

Note: This hint emphasizes you need to be careful with the ordering of the input bits in the Karnaugh map when deriving the logic expression.
