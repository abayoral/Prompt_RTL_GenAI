Could you please provide detailed instructions on how to create a module that implements a NOT gate using Verilog? The module should have one input and one output. Additionally, can you touch upon the differences between the bitwise-NOT (~) and logical-NOT (!) operators in Verilog, similar to how these operators function in the C programming language? It is important to clarify that, since we are dealing with only a single bit in this scenario, either operator can be used. Could you also include a placeholder comment indicating where the Verilog code should be inserted within the module?

Here's the initial structure of the module for reference:

```verilog
module top_module( input in, output out );

//Insert your code here

endmodule
```
