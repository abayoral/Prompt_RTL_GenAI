Certainly! Here is a more detailed version of your initial question:

---

Construct a module named `top_module` that functions as a decade counter. This counter should have the following characteristics:

1. **Counting Range**: The counter must count from 0 to 9, inclusive, which gives it a period of 10 (i.e., it cycles back to 0 after reaching 9).
2. **Synchronous Reset**: Include an input named `reset` that, when asserted, synchronously resets the counter to 0 on the next rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. This means the reset action is synchronized with the clock signal rather than happening immediately.
3. **Enable Control**: Include an additional input named `slowena` (short for "slow enable"). This input will control whether the counter increments on each clock cycle. Specifically, the counter should increment only if `slowena` is asserted (i.e., is high). If `slowena` is deasserted (i.e., is low), the counter should maintain its current value and not increment.
4. **Output**: Provide a 4-bit output `q` that represents the current counter value.

To summarize, your task is to write the Verilog code for a module that implements this counter with the specified functionalities. Here is the skeleton of the `top_module` that you should complete:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input slowena,
    input reset,
    output [3:0] q);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Complete the implementation to meet the described behavior for counting, resetting, and enabling.
