Sure, let's rephrase and expand the question to clarify its requirements:

---

You are tasked with creating and instantiating a module named `mod_a` within a top-level Verilog module. The module `mod_a` already exists and its internal implementation is provided; your focus should be on correctly instantiating it and making the necessary connections to the top-level module's ports.

Here are your objectives in detail:

1. **Instantiate One Instance of `mod_a`:** Create a single instance of the predefined module `mod_a` within the `top_module`.

2. **Mapping Ports:** The module `mod_a` has three ports:
   - `in1`: an input port
   - `in2`: an input port
   - `out`: an output port
  
   These ports need to be connected to the corresponding ports of your top-level module, `top_module`. The top-level module has three main ports:
   - `a`: an input port
   - `b`: an input port
   - `out`: an output port

3. **Understand Module Instantiation:** Focus solely on how the ports of the instantiated `mod_a` module will be connected to the `top_module` ports. You do not need to consider the internal workings of `mod_a`, only its interface is relevant for this task.

4. **Implement the Connections:** Write the necessary Verilog code within the `top_module` to achieve this:

- Connect `top_module`'s input port `a` to `mod_a`'s input port `in1`.
- Connect `top_module`'s input port `b` to `mod_a`'s input port `in2`.
- Connect `top_module`'s output port `out` to `mod_a`'s output port `out`.

Given this context, you are required to modify the `top_module` as follows:

```verilog
module top_module ( input a, input b, output out );
    // Insert your code here to instantiate module mod_a
endmodule
```

Remember, the hint provided states that you only need to focus on the connections between the ports and not on the implementation details of `mod_a`.

With these instructions clarified, proceed to instantiate `mod_a` within your `top_module` and ensure the correct mapping of ports accordingly.
