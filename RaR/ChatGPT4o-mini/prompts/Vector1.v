Certainly! Here's an expanded and clarified version of the question:

**Task Description:**

You are required to design a combinational digital circuit using Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). This circuit will take a single 16-bit input signal and split it into two separate 8-bit output signals.

**Specifications:**

1. The input to the circuit is a 16-bit binary number, denoted as `in`, and represented by `[15:0]`. This means the input consists of 16 bits ranging from bit 15 (most significant bit) to bit 0 (least significant bit).

2. The output of the circuit should consist of two 8-bit binary numbers:
    - `out_hi`: This 8-bit output should correspond to the upper byte of the 16-bit input. In other words, `out_hi` should represent the bits from positions 15 to 8 of the input `in`.
    - `out_lo`: This 8-bit output should correspond to the lower byte of the 16-bit input. In other words, `out_lo` should represent the bits from positions 7 to 0 of the input `in`.

**Requirements:**
- Use Verilog HDL to describe the combinational circuit within the provided module template.
- Ensure that you disable implicit nets by using the directive `default_nettype none` at the beginning of your code, which helps in reducing certain types of bugs.
- Fill in the section of the code indicated by `// Insert your code here` with the appropriate Verilog code that implements the splitting functionality.

**Template:**
```verilog
`default_nettype none     // Disable implicit nets. Reduces some types of bugs.
module top_module( 
    input wire [15:0] in,
    output wire [7:0] out_hi,
    output wire [7:0] out_lo );

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Feel free to expand the code as necessary to meet the outlined specifications, ensuring each bit in the input is correctly mapped to its appropriate output.
