Please clarify and provide detailed instructions for implementing an AND gate using both an `assign` statement and a combinational `always` block within the specified Verilog module. Ensure that the implementations adhere to the syntax and semantics of Verilog-2001.

Specifically, the task involves:

1. **Assign Statement Implementation:** 
   - Use an `assign` statement to create the behavior of an AND gate that will generate the output signal `out_assign`.

2. **Combinational Always Block Implementation:**
   - Write a combinational `always` block that models the behavior of an AND gate to generate the output signal `out_alwaysblock`.

### Verilog Module Specification:
```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module(
    input a, 
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,       // Output signal using assign statement
    output reg out_alwaysblock    // Output signal using always block
);

    // Insert your assign statement here to implement AND gate

    // Insert your combinational always block here to implement AND gate

endmodule
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure the AND gate logic correctly reflects the logical AND operation between the inputs `a` and `b`.
- Both implementations should be placed within the provided `top_module`.
- The use of Verilog-2001 specific syntax and constructs is required as indicated by the line `// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001`.

Clarify and include all necessary code components within `top_module` to fully implement the specified logic for both `out_assign` and `out_alwaysblock`.
