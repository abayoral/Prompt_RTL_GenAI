The given code snippet describes a scenario where you have a module named `mod_a` defined with six ports: two output ports followed by four input ports. Your task is to instantiate `mod_a` within a top-level module and appropriately connect the ports. To be precise, you need to map the top-level module's ports `out1`, `out2`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to the respective ports of `mod_a` in the specified sequence. 

The definition of `mod_a` is as follows:
```verilog
module mod_a ( output, output, input, input, input, input );
```

And your top-level module is defined as:
```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Specifically, you need to instantiate `mod_a` inside the `top_module` and ensure that:
1. `out1` from the `top_module` is connected to the first output port of `mod_a`.
2. `out2` from the `top_module` is connected to the second output port of `mod_a`.
3. The input ports `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the `top_module` are connected in order to the corresponding input ports of `mod_a`.

Essentially, within the `top_module`, you'll need to map each of these ports to align with the sequence defined in `mod_a`. This requires correctly matching each port of the top-level module with the appropriate port in `mod_a` to ensure proper functionality. 

Here is the complete `top_module` structure where you have to add the instantiation of `mod_a`:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
``` 

Remember, the connections must align exactly with the order specified: outputs first followed by inputs. The expanded task involves ensuring that the `mod_a` instance within `top_module` is connected accurately as described.
