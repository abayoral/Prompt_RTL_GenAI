Sure, let's make the question more detailed and clearer:

---

In digital design, you may be familiar with flip-flops that trigger state changes on either the positive edge or the negative edge of a clock signal. These are known as positive-edge triggered and negative-edge triggered flip-flops, respectively. However, a dual-edge triggered flip-flop is one that can trigger state changes on both the rising edge (positive edge) and the falling edge (negative edge) of a clock signal. Unfortunately, most FPGAs do not provide built-in dual-edge triggered flip-flops. Attempting to use the sensitivity list `always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)` in Verilog is also not allowed, as it is not syntactically legal.

**Objective:**

Design and build a circuit that functionally behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using Verilog. The circuit should be able to trigger and store the input signal 'd' on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal 'clk', and it should output this stored value on the output signal 'q'.

**Guidelines and Hints:**

1. While you can't directly implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop in most FPGAs, you can utilize both positive-edge triggered and negative-edge triggered flip-flops to achieve the desired behavior.
2. Think about how you can combine the functionalities of both types of flip-flops to create a single output that reflects changes on both edges of the clock.
3. This task is predominantly a circuit design challenge rather than a complicated Verilog coding problem. Therefore, it may be beneficial to sketch out the circuit by hand to understand the design before writing the Verilog code.
4. The solution should be implemented within the provided Verilog module template.

**Verilog Module Template:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Use basic Verilog constructs to implement the solution. The focus should be on achieving the dual-edge triggering functionality using the given resources and constraints.
