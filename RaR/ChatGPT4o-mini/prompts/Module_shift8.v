The task requires you to work with a given module named `my_dff8`, which implements an array of eight D flip-flops (DFFs). This module accepts an 8-bit input `d` and a clock signal `clk`, and produces an 8-bit output `q` corresponding to the stored values in these flip-flops at each clock cycle.

Your objective is to instantiate three instances of the `my_dff8` module and connect them in a series to form an 8-bit wide, length-3 shift register. This means that the output of the first instance should feed into the input of the second instance, and the output of the second instance should feed into the input of the third instance. This chaining will effectively create a shift register that delays the input data by three clock cycles.

Additionally, you need to design and incorporate a 4-to-1 multiplexer. This multiplexer will take four 8-bit inputs and select one of them based on the 2-bit select signal `sel`. The four inputs to the multiplexer are:
1. The original 8-bit input `d` without any delay.
2. The 8-bit output after the first DFF (after one clock cycle delay).
3. The 8-bit output after the second DFF (after two clock cycles delay).
4. The 8-bit output after the third DFF (after three clock cycles delay).

Therefore, depending on the value of `sel`, the multiplexer will output the input data delayed by 0 to 3 clock cycles.

Here is the problem rephrased and expanded with the details provided:

You are provided with a Verilog module `my_dff8` that represents an array of eight D flip-flops. This module has two inputs: a clock signal `clk` and an 8-bit data input `d`. It produces an 8-bit output `q` which represents the stored values in the D flip-flops. The module definition is as follows:
```verilog
module my_dff8 ( input clk, input [7:0] d, output [7:0] q );
```
Your task is to develop a `top_module` which performs the following:
1. Instantiate three `my_dff8` modules.
2. Connect these instances in a series to form an 8-bit wide shift register of length 3. This means the output `q` of the first module should connect to the input `d` of the second module, and similarly, the output `q` of the second module should connect to the input `d` of the third module.
3. Create a 4-to-1 multiplexer that selects one of the four 8-bit signals based on a 2-bit select signal `sel`. The four signals to be selected are:
   - The original input `d`.
   - The output of the first `my_dff8` instance (after one clock cycle).
   - The output of the second `my_dff8` instance (after two clock cycles).
   - The output of the third `my_dff8` instance (after three clock cycles).
4. The output of this multiplexer should be assigned to the output `q` of the `top_module`.

The `top_module`'s interface is defined as:
```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input clk, 
    input [7:0] d, 
    input [1:0] sel, 
    output [7:0] q 
);
    // Implement your code inside this module
endmodule
```

Your implementation within `top_module` will need to achieve the described functionality, ensuring the correct instantiation of the `my_dff8` modules and the creation of a working multiplexer that selects the appropriate delayed output based on the `sel` signal.
