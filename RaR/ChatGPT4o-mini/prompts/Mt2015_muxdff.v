To implement hierarchical Verilog code for a given sequential circuit, you are required to write a Verilog module named `top_module`. This module should encapsulate a submodule that integrates both a flip-flop and a multiplexer. The specific context for this question includes the need to instantiate this submodule three times within a higher-level design. Here are the key details that you need to consider:

1. **Module Definition:**
   - The module should be named `top_module`.
   - It must include the following ports:
     - An input clock signal (`clk`).
     - An input load signal (`L`).
     - An input reset signal (`r_in`).
     - An additional input representing the current state of the flip-flop (`q_in`).
     - An output signal representing the new state of the flip-flop (`Q`).

2. **Functionality:**
   - The submodule is required to hold one flip-flop and one multiplexer.
   - The multiplexer should use the load signal (`L`) to determine its input. Specifically, when `L` is high, the multiplexer should select the input signal `r_in` to be loaded into the flip-flop. When `L` is low, the multiplexer should select `q_in` as the input to the flip-flop.

3. **Sequential Circuit:**
   - This submodule itself forms the essential building block of the overall sequential circuit.
   - You are expected to implement the internals of this submodule that will be instantiated three times elsewhere in the higher-level design.

Given this information, rewrite the Verilog module definition for `top_module` and ensure that it appropriately represents the submodule with the flip-flop and multiplexer functionality. Additionally, bear in mind that while creating this hierarchical design, you will eventually need to instantiate this submodule within a larger module three times to form the complete sequential circuit. Your task is to define the `top_module` properly so it serves as the correct building block for such instantiations. 

Here is the template for the given `top_module`:

```verilog
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input L,
	input r_in,
	input q_in,
	output reg Q);

	// Insert your code here as per the specified functionality

endmodule
```

Note that you should develop the inner logic of the `top_module` to conform to the described requirements, implementing the flip-flop and multiplexer functionalities accurately.
