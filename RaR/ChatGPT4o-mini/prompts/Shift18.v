The task involves constructing a digital module, specifically a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with the capability for synchronous loading of data. This register should be able to perform both left and right shifts, controlled by a selectable amount, either by 1 or 8 bit positions. It's important to clarify the operational requirements and inputs for this module:

1. Explain the Concept of an Arithmetic Shift:
   - An arithmetic shift is different from a logical shift when it comes to right shifting. While both logical and arithmetic left shifts are identical, an arithmetic right shift preserves the sign of the number by shifting in the most significant bit (sign bit) instead of zero.

2. Inputs and Their Functions:
   - `clk`: The clock input for synchronizing operations. All shifts and loads should occur on the rising edge of this clock signal.
   - `load`: A control signal indicating whether the shift register should be loaded with new data. If this signal is asserted (typically logic high), the register should take in the new input data rather than performing a shift operation.
   - `ena`: The enable signal for shifting. If asserted, the register performs a shift according to the `amount` specified.

3. Shift Control through `amount`:
   - This 2-bit signal determines the direction and magnitude of the shift operation:
     - `2'b00`: Shift left by 1 bit. Every bit in the register is shifted one position to the left.
     - `2'b01`: Shift left by 8 bits. This means every bit is moved eight positions to the left.
     - `2'b10`: Arithmetic shift right by 1 bit. The most significant bit is shifted rightward and the sign bit is preserved.
     - `2'b11`: Arithmetic shift right by 8 bits, maintaining the sign bit.

4. Output:
   - `q`: This is the 64-bit register output which holds the current value of the shift register. It reflects either the newly loaded data, the result of a left shift, or the result of an arithmetic right shift.

5. Functional Insight:
   - The register ensures that during a logical left or arithmetic right shift, the output maintains correct data integrity. With a right shift, attention should be given to the sign of the number (q[63]) to differentiate between signed and unsigned data handling.

For the module to work correctly, the design should ensure that all operations are conducted synchronously with the clock signal, and that each control signal works precisely as described for load and shift operations. The temporary storage and manipulation of data during shifting must respect these constraints to achieve the desired functionality.
