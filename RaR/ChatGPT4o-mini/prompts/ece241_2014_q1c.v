Can you elaborate on the process of detecting a signed overflow in an 8-bit 2's complement addition operation? Given the context where you have two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, labeled `a[7:0]` and `b[7:0]`, which are summed to produce the result `s[7:0]`, the objective is to determine whether a signed overflow has occurred. 

A signed overflow specifically happens in two scenarios:
1. When adding two positive numbers (where the most significant bit, or MSB, is 0 for both `a` and `b`) results in a negative number (where the MSB of `s` becomes 1).
2. When adding two negative numbers (where the MSB is 1 for both `a` and `b`) results in a positive number (where the MSB of `s` becomes 0).

Furthermore, there are various methods to identify an overflow. One approach involves comparing the signs (i.e., the MSB) of the operands (`a` and `b`) with the sign of the result (`s`). Another method checks the carry-out bits of the two highest-order bits (bit positions 7 and 6).

Please explain how to modify the provided Verilog module, which includes inputs `a` and `b`, outputs `s` and `overflow`, and a placeholder for the necessary functionality. Hereâ€™s the module template provided for reference:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
); 

    // Insert your code below
    // assign s = ...
    // assign overflow = ...

endmodule
```

Could you help describe the logic and methodology to accurately assign the values of `s` and `overflow` within this module?
