The provided task involves utilizing a BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) one-digit adder module, named `bcd_fadd`, that is capable of adding two single BCD digits along with an additional carry-in bit. The `bcd_fadd` module then produces a BCD sum and a carry-out bit.

Here is the module definition for `bcd_fadd` for reference:

```verilog
module bcd_fadd (
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input     cin,
    output   cout,
    output [3:0] sum );
```

The goal is to extend the functionality of this one-digit BCD adder by instantiating four instances of the `bcd_fadd` module to create a 4-digit BCD ripple-carry adder. This extended adder should be capable of adding two 4-digit BCD numbers, which are provided as 16-bit vectors, along with an initial carry-in bit. The result should be a 4-digit BCD sum and an overall carry-out bit.

For clarity:
1. Each 4-bit segment of the 16-bit input vectors `a` and `b` represents a single BCD digit.
2. You need to chain the four `bcd_fadd` instances in such a way that the carry-out from one instance feeds into the carry-in of the next instance, similar to the design of a binary ripple-carry adder.
3. The final output will be a 16-bit vector representing the 4-digit BCD sum, and a single carry-out bit indicating overflow past the least significant digit.

To help visualize the task, consider that each digit will traverse through its respective `bcd_fadd` instance in a manner similar to the structure of a traditional binary ripple-carry adder, but adapted for base-10 operations.

Here's a simplified representation of how one `bcd_fadd` instance might be linked:

```verilog
top_module instance (
    .a(a[3:0]),      // first BCD digit of 'a'
    .b(b[3:0]),      // first BCD digit of 'b'
    .cin(cin),       // initial carry-in
    .cout(some wire),// intermediate carry-out
    .sum(sum[3:0])   // first digit of the result sum
);
```

Now, your task is to complete the `top_module` to handle all four digits, ensuring that you appropriately manage the carry-out and carry-in signals between the chained `bcd_fadd` instances.

Here is the starting point for the `top_module` definition:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input [15:0] a, b,
    input cin,
    output cout,
    output [15:0] sum );

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

What is required:
- How to instantiate and connect the four `bcd_fadd` modules.
- Proper management of intermediate carry-out and carry-in signals.
- Correct interpretation of the input and output BCD numbers in the given 16-bit format.

Bear in mind the BCD encoding and how it differs from pure binary representation, particularly illustrated by the hint regarding the number 12345. Use this understanding to ensure the correct addition behavior within the `bcd_fadd` instances.
