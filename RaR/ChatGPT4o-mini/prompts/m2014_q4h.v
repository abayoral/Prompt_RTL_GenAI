Certainly! Here is a more detailed version of the question:

---

Task:
Design a simple digital circuit using Verilog, a hardware description language commonly used in the field of electronics and electrical engineering for designing and describing digital and mixed-signal systems.

Given: 
- You need to implement a Verilog module named `top_module`.

Inputs and Outputs:
- The module has a single input port named `in` of type logic (implicitly a 1-bit signal).
- The module also has a single output port named `out`, also of type logic and 1-bit in size.

Instructions:
1. Create a Verilog module with the name `top_module`.
2. Declare the input port `in`.
3. Declare the output port `out`.
4. Define the internal logic of the module such that it meets the requirements specified by the problem statement.

The skeleton of the module has been provided below. Your task is to complete this module by inserting the necessary Verilog code within the `// Insert your code here` section to ensure that the circuit functions correctly as per the requirements.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input in,
    output out);
    
    // Insert your code here
    
endmodule
```

Additional Notes:
- Keep in mind that the `input` and `output` ports are predefined in the module declaration.
- Consider the most straightforward approach to connect the input to the output based on typical digital circuit design principles.

Your final design should ensure that all specified inputs and outputs function correctly within the structure of the module. Please write the necessary Verilog code to achieve this.
