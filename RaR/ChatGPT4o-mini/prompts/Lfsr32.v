Certainly! Here's an expanded and clarified version of the question:

Design and implement a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with specific tap positions at bits 32, 22, 2, and 1. The LFSR should be initialized to `32'h1` when an active-high synchronous reset signal is asserted.

The module you create, named `top_module`, should have the following characteristics:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `clk`: Clock signal.
   - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal which sets the LFSR to `32'h1`.

2. **Outputs:**
   - `q`: 32-bit output vector representing the current state of the LFSR.

Guidance:
- Instead of using 32 individual D flip-flops (DFFs) for each bit of the LFSR, utilize vectors to efficiently manage the 32-bit data.

The framework of the Verilog module is provided below with placeholders where you will need to insert your implementation logic.

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input reset,    // Active-high synchronous reset to 32'h1
    output [31:0] q
); 

	// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Using the provided framework, your task is to appropriately implement the LFSR functionality considering the aforementioned details and tools.
