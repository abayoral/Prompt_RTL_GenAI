The programming task involves implementing a one-dimensional cellular automaton known as Rule 110. This automaton features a linear array of cells, each of which can be either on or off (1 or 0). The state of each cell in the subsequent time step is determined solely by its current state and the states of its immediate neighbors (left and right) based on a predefined set of rules detailed in a table.

Here is a detailed view of the procedure and rules:

1. **Rule 110 State Transition Table:**
   - This table specifies how to compute the next state for a cell based on the current states of the cell itself and its two immediate neighbors:
     ```
     Left	Center	Right	 Center's Next State
     1	    1	    1	      0
     1	    1	    0	      1
     1	    0	    1	      1
     1	    0	    0	      0
     0	    1	    1	      1
     0	    1	    0	      1
     0	    0	    1	      1
     0	    0	    0	      0
     ```
   - The name "Rule 110" is derived from the binary representation of the "Centerâ€™s next state" column (01101110), which converts to decimal 110.

2. **Implementation Factors:**
   - **Array Size:** The system consists of an array of 512 cells, indexed from 0 to 511.
   - **Boundary Conditions:** Cells outside the defined range (q[-1] and q[512]) are assumed to be zero.
   - **Clock Cycle Update:** On every clock cycle, the state of the entire array should advance by one time step following Rule 110.
   - **Load Operation:** If the `load` input is active, it should set the state of the system to the value provided by the `data` input (another 512-bit vector).

3. **Initial State Example:** If starting with all cells off except the zeroth cell (e.g., q[511:0] = 1), the first few iterations according to Rule 110 would yield the patterns:
   ```
   Time Step 0: 1
   Time Step 1: 11
   Time Step 2: 111
   Time Step 3: 1101
   Time Step 4: 11111
   Time Step 5: 110001
   Time Step 6: 1110011
   Time Step 7: 11010111
   ```

4. **Module Definition:**
   - The module `top_module` should be defined with:
     - **Inputs:**
       - `clk` (clock signal)
       - `load` (load command for setting initial state)
       - `data` (512-bit input vector to load as the system state when `load` is active)
     - **Outputs:**
       - `q` (512-bit output vector representing the current state of the system)

Below is the provided module declaration template where the functional code should be inserted:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output [511:0] q
); 

	// Insert your implementation here

endmodule
```

The implementation should ensure that at each clock cycle, the state of the cells updates according to Rule 110, while handling the edge cases effectively by considering the boundary conditions mentioned.
