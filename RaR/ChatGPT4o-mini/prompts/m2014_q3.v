Sure! Here is the expanded version of your question with additional details and clarity:

---

Consider the Boolean function \( f \) represented by the Karnaugh map (K-map) provided below. Each cell of the K-map corresponds to a specific combination of the input variables \( x_1, x_2, x_3, \) and \( x_4 \), where the map layouts and values are given. Note that 'd' represents a "don't-care" condition, meaning for those specific input combinations, the output can be chosen as either 0 or 1 to simplify the function implementation.

The Karnaugh map for function \( f \) is as follows, where each cell is labeled by the values of \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) across the columns and by \( x_3 \) and \( x_4 \) across the rows:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
& x_1'x_2' & x_1'x_2 & x_1x_2 & x_1x_2' \\
\hline
x_3'x_4' & d & 0 & d & d \\
x_3'x_4 & 0 & d & 1 & 0 \\
x_3x_4 & 1 & 1 & d & d \\
x_3x_4' & 1 & 1 & 0 & d \\
\end{array}
\]

You are tasked with implementing this Boolean function using Verilog code. The module named `top_module` should take a 4-bit input vector `x` (where \(x[4:1]\) represents \( x_4, x_3, x_2, x_1 \)) and produce a single output `f`.

Here is the skeleton of the Verilog code provided:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [4:1] x, 
    output f );

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Fill in the `top_module` with the appropriate logic that reflects the given K-map. Make sure to appropriately handle the 'don't-care' conditions to potentially simplify your implementation.
