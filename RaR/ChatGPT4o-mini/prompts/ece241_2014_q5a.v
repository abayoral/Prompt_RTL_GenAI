Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more detailed and elaborated version of the original question:

Design a serial 2's complementer Moore state machine that takes a single-bit input stream and produces a single-bit output stream. The input stream, denoted as 'x', consists of bits representing the binary number in a least-significant-bit-first (LSB-first) order. Consequently, the first bit received on the input line 'x' is the least significant bit (LSB) of the number, and subsequent bits provide progressively more significant bits (MSB).

The desired output stream, represented by 'z', is the 2's complement of the binary number provided by the input stream. The conversion process should handle input numbers of arbitrary length, meaning the number of bits in the input sequence is not predetermined or fixed.

The state machine needs to support an asynchronous reset functionality. While the reset signal ('areset') is asserted (high), the machine should be in a reset state, and the conversion process should not occur. Once the reset signal is deasserted (low), the machine begins the 2's complement conversion for the incoming bit stream. The reset signal should again be able to terminate the conversion process immediately when reasserted (high).

You are required to implement this state machine within the provided Verilog module framework. The module is defined as follows:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,      // Clock signal
    input areset,   // Asynchronous reset signal
    input x,        // Single-bit input stream
    output z        // Single-bit output stream
); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

To summarize, the objectives are:
1. Create a Moore state machine for 2's complement conversion of a serial bit stream.
2. Manage the input bit stream 'x' in LSB-first order and produce the corresponding 2's complement output stream 'z'.
3. Ensure an asynchronous reset 'areset' correctly handles the reset state.

Insert your implementation within the provided Verilog module template.
