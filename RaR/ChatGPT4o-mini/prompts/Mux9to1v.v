Certainly! Here is the revised and expanded question:

---

Develop a Verilog module that implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer. The multiplexer should have nine 16-bit wide input channels labeled as `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and `i`. Additionally, the module should feature a 4-bit wide select input (`sel`) and a 16-bit wide output (`out`). 

The functionality of this multiplexer should be as follows:
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b0000 (decimal 0), the output `out` should correspond to input `a`.
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b0001 (decimal 1), the output `out` should correspond to input `b`.
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b0010 (decimal 2), the output `out` should correspond to input `c`.
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b0011 (decimal 3), the output `out` should correspond to input `d`.
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b0100 (decimal 4), the output `out` should correspond to input `e`.
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b0101 (decimal 5), the output `out` should correspond to input `f`.
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b0110 (decimal 6), the output `out` should correspond to input `g`.
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b0111 (decimal 7), the output `out` should correspond to input `h`.
- When `sel` is equal to 4'b1000 (decimal 8), the output `out` should correspond to input `i`.

For the remaining cases where `sel` ranges from 4'b1001 (decimal 9) to 4'b1111 (decimal 15), the output `out` should be set to a 16-bit value where all bits are '1' (16'b1111111111111111).

Please implement this functionality in the given module using a `case` statement, as it might help to handle multiple conditions efficiently.

Here is the shell of the module for reference:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [15:0] a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,
    input [3:0] sel,
    output [15:0] out );

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Ensure that your Verilog code is syntactically correct and adheres to the described functionality.
