The provided Verilog module is designed to perform either addition or subtraction based on the `do_sub` control signal and to indicate if the result is zero via the `result_is_zero` output. There are, however, some issues preventing it from functioning as intended. Please review and address the following points to fix the bugs:

1. Evaluate whether the addition or subtraction operation functionality as specified by the `do_sub` signal works correctly.
2. Ensure that the `result_is_zero` flag correctly indicates when the result of the operation (`out`) is zero.
3. Consider the specific Verilog syntax and semantics that may affect the current logic implementation, especially the check for zero in the `result_is_zero` assignment.
   
Additionally, ensure the following:
- The `do_sub` signal is properly used as a control signal for the arithmetic operation (`a + b` for addition and `a - b` for subtraction).
- The `result_is_zero` flag is correctly updated to reflect whether the `out` signal equals zero immediately after the arithmetic operation.
- Proper use of synthesis-compliant code to ensure the module behaves as intended during hardware implementation.

Review the code in its entirety, focusing on the identified issues, and provide necessary corrections or improvements to achieve the desired functionality.
