The current implementation of a three-input NAND gate using a provided 5-input AND gate appears to be malfunctioning. Your task is to identify and rectify the issue(s) in the code. The provided module for the 5-input AND gate should be utilized appropriately. Below is the current code implementation for reference:

```verilog
module andgate ( output out, input a, input b, input c, input d, input e );

module top_module (input a, input b, input c, output out);

    andgate inst1 ( a, b, c, out ); 

endmodule
```

Please review the following points:

1. The provided 5-input AND gate module, `andgate`, is defined with inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`, and an output `out`.
2. The top-level module, `top_module`, is intended to utilize this 5-input AND gate to create a three-input NAND gate. However, it seems there might be misunderstandings or errors in the connection and usage of the inputs and outputs.
3. Verify the connections and logic required to implement a three-input NAND gate correctly, and ensure the output behaves as expected.
4. Consider how to handle the unused inputs of the 5-input AND gate and how to properly generate the NAND functionality using the logic.

You are to modify the given code such that the `top_module` accurately implements a three-input NAND gate using the provided 5-input AND gate module, with correct connections and logic.
