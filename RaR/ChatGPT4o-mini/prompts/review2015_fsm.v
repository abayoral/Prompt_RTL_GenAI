We are looking to design a sequential logic circuit in Verilog that will control a timer using a finite-state machine (FSM). The desired behavior of this FSM can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Detection of a Specific Bit Pattern**: The FSM should continuously monitor the serial data input (`data`) for the specific bit pattern `1101`. This means the FSM needs to have a mechanism to detect when this four-bit sequence appears in the serial input data stream.

2. **Shifting Additional Bits for Duration Calculation**: Once the bit pattern `1101` has been detected, the FSM should assert an output signal `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles. This signal enables a shift register or similar component, which will read in the next four bits of serial data. These four bits represent the duration for which the timer will subsequently delay.

3. **Waiting for Counters to Complete**: After the 4 additional bits have been shifted in, the FSM should assert an output signal `counting` to indicate that it is now in the delay phase, waiting for the counters to finish counting. This state persists until the input signal `done_counting` becomes high, signaling that the delay period has ended.

4. **Notifying the User**: When the `done_counting` input is high, meaning the delay phase has completed, the FSM should assert another output signal, `done`, to notify the user that the timer has timed out. The FSM must remain in this state and continue to assert the `done` signal until it detects the `ack` input signal going high, which indicates that the user has acknowledged the timer event.

5. **Resetting and Searching for the Next Pattern**: Once the user acknowledgment (`ack`) is received, the FSM should reset itself and begin searching for the next occurrence of the bit pattern `1101` in the serial data input stream. 

Additionally, a synchronous reset (`reset`) input should ensure that the FSM can be reset to its initial state for detecting the start sequence when required.

To summarize, the FSM must transition through these states:
- **Initial state**: Search for the bit pattern `1101`.
- **Pattern detected state**: Assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles.
- **Counting state**: Assert `counting` and wait for `done_counting`.
- **Done state**: Assert `done` and wait for `ack`.
- **Acknowledged state**: Transition back to the initial state after `ack` is received.

Below is the Verilog module definition that includes the necessary inputs and outputs for this FSM. You will need to implement the states and state transitions inside this module.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,      // Synchronous reset
    input data,       // Serial data input
    output shift_ena, // Enable signal for shifting in duration bits
    output counting,  // Signal indicating that the FSM is in the counting state
    input done_counting, // Signal indicating that counting is done
    output done,      // Signal to notify the user that the timer has timed out
    input ack );      // Acknowledgment input from the user

    // Insert your state machine code here

endmodule
```
