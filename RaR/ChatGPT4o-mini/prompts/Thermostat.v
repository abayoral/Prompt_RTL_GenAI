Certainly! Here's a rephrased and expanded version of the initial question:

---

A thermostat system is designed to control both heating and cooling mechanisms in a home, acting differently depending on whether it is in heating mode or cooling mode. The goal is to create a digital circuit to manage the operations of a heater, an air conditioner, and a blower fan based on temperature conditions and user requests.

The thermostat can operate in two distinct modes:
1. **Heating Mode (mode = 1):** 
   - In this mode, the heater should be turned on when the environment is too cold (indicated by too_cold = 1).
   - The air conditioner should never be turned on in this mode.

2. **Cooling Mode (mode = 0):** 
   - In this mode, the air conditioner should be turned on when the environment is too hot (indicated by too_hot = 1).
   - The heater should never be turned on in this mode.

Regardless of the mode, when either the heater or the air conditioner is on, a blower fan must also be turned on to circulate the air. Additionally, the user has the option to force the fan to be on independently of the heater and air conditioner by setting (fan_on = 1).

Your task is to implement a logic circuit using Verilog that manages the heater, air conditioner, and blower fan based on these conditions. Specifically, you should:

- Turn on the heater only in heating mode and only when it is too cold.
- Turn on the air conditioner only in cooling mode and only when it is too hot.
- Turn on the fan whenever the heater or air conditioner is on, or whenever the user requests the fan to be on.

You should use only combinational logic (assign statements) to implement this circuit, ensuring that it translates directly into a collection of logic gates.

Below is the skeleton of the Verilog module that you need to complete. Fill in the logic expressions accordingly:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot,
    input mode,
    input fan_on,
    output heater,
    output aircon,
    output fan
); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Remember, when designing circuits, it can be helpful to work backwards from the outputs to determine the necessary logic for the inputs.
