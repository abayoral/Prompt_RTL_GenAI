**Task: Implement a D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset in Verilog**

You are required to create a Verilog module that defines a D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset functionality. Below is a skeleton of the module for you to complete. This D flip-flop should have the following features:

- **Clock input (clk):** The positive edge of this signal will be used to sample the D input and update the Q output.
- **Data input (d):** This is the data input to the flip-flop. On the positive edge of the clock, if the asynchronous reset (ar) is not active, this data will be transferred to the output Q.
- **Asynchronous Reset input (ar):** When this signal is asserted (for example, high), it will immediately reset the output Q to a defined logic level (usually 0). This reset happens independently of the clock signal.
- **Output (q):** This is the output of the flip-flop that holds the value of the D input sampled on the clock's positive edge. It is also affected by the asynchronous reset.

You should provide code that correctly implements this behavior within the module named `top_module`.

Here is the provided template for you to complete:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d, 
    input ar,   // asynchronous reset
    output q);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Please ensure that the D flip-flop updates its state on the rising edge of the clock and responds immediately to the asynchronous reset signal.
