As a professional engaged in Verilog design, you are tasked with a detailed implementation of an asynchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer. This project involves creating a structure that supports adjustable configurations for both bit width and depth, providing flexibility in data management. Central to this implementation is the dual-port RAM module, which will serve as the primary storage component for the FIFO. 

In the design specifications, the dual-port RAM must be instantiated as a submodule and needs to handle multiple inputs, including the write clock signal (`wclk`), a write enable signal (`wenc`), a write address (`waddr`), the written data (`wdata`), as well as the read clock signal (`rclk`), a read enable signal (`renc`), and the read address (`raddr`). Moreover, the dual-port RAM should output the read data (`rdata`) through a registered output, ensuring that data retrieval is efficient and reliable.

The architecture of the FIFO is organized into several key functional components. Initially, the dual-port RAM deals specifically with the storage of data, making use of its separate read and write ports for concurrent operations. This requires the design of a data write controller to orchestrate the writing process and a data read controller to effectively manage data retrieval. Additionally, you will implement two pointer synchronizers: one tasked with synchronizing the read pointer to the write clock and another aimed at synchronizing the write pointer to the read clock. These synchronization mechanisms are crucial for ensuring stability when interfacing across disparate clock domains, a common scenario in asynchronous FIFO setups.

In terms of FIFO management, including flags for 'empty' and 'full' status, utilizing Gray code encoding is recommended to minimize potential race conditions and ensure accurate status detection. For a FIFO depth set at 8 entries, the read and write pointers should employ 4-bit Gray codes, which will then be converted back to binary format for address generation within the RAM. A FIFO is considered to be in an 'empty' state when the read and write pointers are in alignment. Conversely, it is deemed 'full' when the pointers differ solely in their most significant bit while being identical in all other bit positions.

When defining the module `asyn_fifo`, you will need to specify key inputs including the write clock signal (`wclk`), the read clock signal (`rclk`), and reset signals for both write (`wrstn`) and read (`rrstn`) operations. Also, it should accept signals for write increments (`winc`) and read increments (`rinc`), along with the input data (`wdata`). The outputs of your module should feature flags indicating whether the FIFO is 'full' (`wfull`) or 'empty' (`rempty`), as well as the read data flow through `rdata`.

In considering the overall functionality, ensure that the parameters governing the `WIDTH` and `DEPTH` of the FIFO are configurable yet default to values of 8 bits for width and 16 entries for depth, allowing for adaptable applications based on varying requirements. It is critical that your implementation effectively manages the mechanisms for updating pointers, converting between Gray code and binary formats for accurate address mapping, and maintaining stable synchronization during asynchronous read and write operations using appropriate clock domain crossing techniques.
