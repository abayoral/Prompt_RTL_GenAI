As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, your current responsibility involves creating an essential Verilog module that is integral to the development of a groundbreaking product. The effectiveness of this module is crucial not only for the successful functionality of the product itself but also for upholding the esteemed reputation that your company has established within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

You have been assigned the task of instantiating two separate add16 modules, which are capable of performing 16-bit addition operations. Your goal is to combine these two modules to create a comprehensive 32-bit adder. The first add16 module will be responsible for calculating the lower 16 bits of the combined addition result. Following this, the second add16 module will handle the upper 16 bits, factoring in the carry-out signal produced by the first adder. It is important to note that while your 32-bit adder will not accommodate carry-in and carry-out scenarios (with the assumption that the carry-in is zero and the carry-out is disregarded), the internal functioning of the add16 modules must properly manage these carry signals to ensure seamless operation.

To assist in this process, the provided add16 module is defined as follows:

```verilog
module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );
```

In relation to this, your next step involves crafting the top-level module, designated as `top_module`, which will take two 32-bit inputs and produce a 32-bit sum output. The module signature for `top_module` is as follows:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);
```

Given this context, the question arises: How would you go about connecting the two add16 instances within your top_module to effectively achieve the desired 32-bit addition? In particular, how will you ensure that the outputs from the first add16 module appropriately feed into the second, while managing the carry signals needed for each individual 16-bit addition operation? Please provide the detailed implementation within the `top_module`, highlighting any necessary connections and logic needed to fulfill these requirements without delving into potential solutions or outputs.
