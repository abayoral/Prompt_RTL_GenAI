You have been assigned the responsibility of creating a comprehensive Verilog code implementation for a design module specifically named `synchronizer`. This module aims to function as a multi-bit multiplexer-based (MUX-based) synchronizer, which is intended to manage a data input signal referred to as `data_in`. It is crucial to note that the `data_in` signal should remain stable whenever the accompanying enable signal, `data_en`, is in a high state. Additionally, it is required that the `data_en` signal maintains this high state for a minimum duration of three consecutive clock cycles of the `clk_b` signal to ensure the synchronization of the incoming data is effective.

To clarify and elaborate upon the requirements and considerations for this module, let us delve into several key aspects:

1. **Clock Domains**: 
   - The design operates under two independent clock signals, namely `clk_a` and `clk_b`. 
   - The `clk_a` signal is more closely associated with the input data (`data_in`) and the synchronization enable signal (`data_en`). 
   - Conversely, the `clk_b` signal plays a pivotal role in managing the delay of the `data_en` signal, controlling the synchronization of the output data, and ultimately dictating the final output of the module through the `dataout` signal.

2. **Input Data and Enable Signal Specification**:
   - The `data_in` input signal is defined as a multi-bit signal, specifically comprising 4 bits. 
   - The `data_en` signal acts as a control mechanism, governing the period during which the data may be synchronized across the distinct clock domains.

3. **Synchronization Requirements**:
   - Notably, the behavior of the `data_en` signal must account for a propagation delay that spans two clock cycles; this delay is achieved through the use of two D flip-flops that operate in synchronization with the `clk_b` clock signal.

4. **Asynchronous Reset Signals**:
   - Two asynchronous reset signals are integrated into the design: `arstn`, which pertains to the `clk_a` domain, and `brstn`, designated for the `clk_b` domain. Both reset signals function in an active-low manner, initiating reset actions when they are low.

5. **Module Behavioral Operations**:
   - Within the `clk_a` domain, a register named `data_reg` is employed to latch the `data_in` signal, with its state dictated by the conditions of the enable signal, which operates under the `clk_a` clock.
   - Another register, `en_data_reg`, similarly latches the `data_en` signal.
   - In the `clk_b` domain, two additional registers named `en_clap_one` and `en_clap_two` are implemented to handle the management and delayed propagation of the `data_en` signal in compliance with the clock signal `clk_b`.
   - The final output, denoted as `dataout`, is contingent on the state of the delayed enable signals within the `clk_b` domain.

6. **Design Constraints**:
   - It is imperative to ensure that the behavior of the reset signals effectively initializes all pertinent registers to zero when activated.
   - Upon the release of the reset conditions (when `arstn` is high in the `clk_a` domain and `brstn` is high in the `clk_b` domain), the flow of data must be managed correctly in accordance with the established logic described above.

7. **Output Handling Considerations**:
   - It is critical to derive the `dataout` signal based on the active status of the `en_clap_two` register. In situations where this signal is found to be inactive, the `dataout` should retain its previous state.

Your task is to meticulously encapsulate all of these specifications, requirements, and constraints into a Verilog code implementation that accurately fulfills the intended purpose of a multi-bit MUX-based synchronizer in the `synchronizer` module. Please ensure that your design adheres closely to the outlined behaviors and functionalities detailed above.
