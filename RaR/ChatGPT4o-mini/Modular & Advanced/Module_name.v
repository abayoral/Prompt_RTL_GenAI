As a senior FPGA Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the crucial task of developing a specific Verilog module that plays an essential role in the next-generation product your company is working on. The delivery and functionality of this module are critically important because its success will directly impact the company's reputation in the competitive computer hardware sector.

You are presented with a module called `mod_a`, which consists of 2 output ports and 4 input ports. Your goal is to establish connections between the ports of `mod_a` and the corresponding ports in the top-level module that you are working on. Specifically, you need to wire the following ports appropriately according to the design specifications provided:

- The output port `out1` from `mod_a` should be connected to the output port `out1` of the `top_module`.
- The output port `out2` from `mod_a` needs to be linked to the output port `out2` of the `top_module`.
- The input ports `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, and `in4` from `mod_a` have to be connected to the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` of the `top_module`, respectively.

The structure of both modules is already defined, but it's your responsibility to complete the interconnection in the `top_module`. Given this context, how would you go about implementing the connections of these six ports by name in the `top_module`? Moreover, consider any additional details or considerations that may need to be addressed in order to ensure that the module functions correctly and meets the design requirements.
