Imagine you are serving in a crucial role as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm. Your current project involves the creation of a critical module in Verilog, which is essential for the success of an upcoming next-generation product. The performance and functionality of this module are vital, as they significantly affect your companyâ€™s reputation in the highly competitive computer hardware industry.

Given this context, you are tasked with integrating a provided module, referred to as mod_a, which contains two output ports and four input ports. It's necessary to connect these ports in a specific order to ensure proper functionality within your higher-level module structure. 

The two outputs from mod_a must be linked to the output ports out1 and out2 of your top-level module, while the four inputs from mod_a must correlate with the input ports a, b, c, and d, respectively. This connection must be executed strictly by position to maintain the intended design and behavior.

You have the following definitions for the module mod_a:

```verilog
module mod_a ( output, output, input, input, input, input );
```

As well as the definitions for your top-level module:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);
```

In light of this information, how should you approach the task of connecting the specified ports from mod_a to those defined in your top-level module? What exactly must be done to ensure that the inputs and outputs align correctly according to their designated positions, and what considerations might impact this module's successful integration and overall functionality?
