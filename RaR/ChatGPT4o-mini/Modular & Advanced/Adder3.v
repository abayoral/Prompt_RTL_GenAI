As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned a crucial task involving the development of a Verilog module that is essential for the success of an innovative product. This specific module plays a significant role in upholding the company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

In this context, your challenge is to create a 3-bit binary ripple-carry adder using instances of full adders. The objective is to design a system that can accurately add two 3-bit binary numbers along with a carry-in input, which will generate a 3-bit sum output and a carry-out signal. To ensure that the design emphasizes the importance of the full adder components, you are required to not only implement the addition functionality but also to make the carry-out signals from each of the three full adders accessible. The final carry-out, denoted as cout[2], is particularly significant as it represents the overall carry-out from the last full adder in the sequence.

Please clarify and elaborate on how you would approach the design of this Verilog module, specifically focusing on the implementation of the three full adders while ensuring that the carry-out outputs are correctly wired. In your explanation, consider factors such as the interconnections between the full adders, the handling of carry inputs and outputs, and how you would structure your module to fulfill the outlined requirements effectively. Additionally, please reflect on the implications of this module's performance and accuracy, given its critical role in the overarching product's functionality.
