As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the crucial responsibility of developing a specific Verilog module for an upcoming and high-stakes product. The performance of this module is essential for ensuring that your company maintains its esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of computer hardware. 

In this context, your task involves creating a digital circuit with certain defined characteristics. Specifically, you are to design a module that accepts a single 3-bit input vector. The requirements dictate that this input should not only be output in its original form but also be deconstructed into three distinct 1-bit outputs. Each of these outputs needs to be directly connected to the corresponding bit of the input vector; for instance, the least significant bit (position 0) of the input vector should be routed to the output `o0`, the next bit (position 1) to the output `o1`, and the most significant bit (position 2) to the output `o2`. 

Given these guidelines, how would you approach the implementation of this Verilog module? What considerations might influence your design choices, especially regarding the connectivity of the outputs and the integrity of data flow? What best practices would you employ to ensure that the module meets both functional specifications and industry standards?
