As a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the important task of developing a crucial Verilog module for a next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is essential for upholding your company's esteemed reputation within the highly competitive computer hardware industry.

The module that you need to create is a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux) that selects between two input signals, `a` and `b`. The selection criterion is specific: the mux should output signal `b` when both selection signals, `sel_b1` and `sel_b2`, are asserted to true (or logic high). In all other circumstances, the mux should default to outputting signal `a`.

Your responsibilities include implementing this multiplexer functionality in two different ways within the same Verilog module. First, you will produce the code using continuous assignment statements (`assign`). Subsequently, you will replicate this functionality using a procedural block with an `if` statement.

To clarify, here are the component inputs and outputs that need to be defined in your module:
1. Inputs: 
   - `a`: The first signal to be considered by the mux.
   - `b`: The second signal to be considered by the mux.
   - `sel_b1`: The first selection input that determines which signal to output.
   - `sel_b2`: The second selection input that works in conjunction with `sel_b1` to decide the output.

2. Outputs:
   - `out_assign`: The output of the mux implementation using continuous assignment.
   - `out_always`: The output of the mux implementation using a procedural assignment.

You are to create this module in accordance with the synthesis guidelines for Verilog input version 2001. 

Given these parameters, how might you approach the task of implementing the 2-to-1 mux with the specified selection logic in both formats? What considerations should you keep in mind regarding the design, functionality, and potential implications for performance and resource utilization in the context of hardware design?
