Imagine that you are a senior Digital Design Engineer employed by a prominent hardware design company, recognized for its leadership in the technology sector. You have been assigned a vital project involving the development of a Verilog module that is essential for a next-generation product. The functionality and performance of this module are crucial, as its success plays a significant role in upholding your company's esteemed reputation in the highly competitive field of computer hardware.

In your current assignment, you need to design a module that effectively implements a NOT gate, which is a fundamental building block in digital logic. This module needs to take a single bit as input and produce the corresponding output based on the NOT logic operation. 

As you prepare to write the code, keep in mind that Verilog provides two types of NOT operators: the bitwise NOT operator (~) and the logical NOT operator (!). For this specific case of working with a one-bit value, it is important to consider which of these operators is more appropriate or suitable for your design. 

The structure of your Verilog module should include an input and an output, which you can name as 'in' and 'out' respectively. The module should be encapsulated and properly defined according to Verilog standards, allowing for clear implementation and future testing. 

With these considerations in mind, what specific steps or code implementations will you undertake to effectively create this NOT gate module, while ensuring it meets both functional and performance criteria within the broader context of your next-generation product?
