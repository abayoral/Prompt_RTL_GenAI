As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been assigned a significant responsibility involving the creation of a crucial Verilog module that is essential for a next-generation product. The effectiveness and reliability of this module are vital for upholding our company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry. 

Specifically, the task at hand is to design Module A, which is intended to accurately execute the logical function defined by the equation z = (x^y) & x. This function combines the bitwise XOR operation between inputs x and y and then performs a bitwise AND operation with input x. Given the importance of this module in the overall architecture of the product, it is imperative to ensure that it operates flawlessly.

To this end, the question revolves around the technical implementation details required for constructing Module A in Verilog. What considerations must be taken into account during the coding process to ensure optimal functionality and performance? Additionally, how can one structure the module effectively within the provided framework, represented by the template of the top_module that includes the necessary input and output ports? 

Ultimately, what are the best practices and methodologies that should be followed while developing this module to meet the expectations set forth for the next-generation product? Please focus on articulating the requirements and considerations necessary for the implementation of the specified logic function without providing specific solutions or code examples.
