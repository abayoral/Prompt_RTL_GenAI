Imagine you are working as a senior Digital Design Engineer in a prestigious company specializing in hardware design. You have been entrusted with a significant responsibility: the development of a crucial Verilog module for an innovative product that your company is introducing. This module's design is not merely a technical task; its successful implementation is essential for preserving the excellent reputation your company has built within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Now, your goal is to create a Verilog module that will take three separate input signals and produce four distinct output signals. The requirements for the module are straightforward yet critical: it needs to connect the input signals to the output signals in a specific manner. More explicitly, the connections must be structured as follows: the input signal 'a' should be linked to output 'w', the input signal 'b' should be directed to both outputs 'x' and 'y', and the input signal 'c' should be routed to output 'z'.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to utilize the concatenation operator, which in Verilog is represented as { signal1, signal2, signal3, ... }, to facilitate the organization and management of these signals within the module.

With this background in mind, how should you effectively structure the Verilog code for this module so that it meets all the specified connectivity requirements between inputs and outputs? Please outline the steps and considerations you would take into account while writing this module.
