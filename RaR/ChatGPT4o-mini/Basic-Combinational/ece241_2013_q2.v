As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, I'm currently engaged in the development of a critical Verilog module essential for the success of a next-generation product. This project is crucial, as it directly affects our companyâ€™s standing and reputation within the competitive hardware design industry.

The specific digital logic system I am working on is a single-output configuration that takes in four binary inputs, designated as a, b, c, and d. The functionality of this system is defined such that it produces a logic-high output (1) for the input combinations that correspond to the decimal values of 2, 7, or 15. Conversely, the system outputs a logic-low signal (0) for any combination that corresponds to the decimal values of 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14. Importantly, the inputs for the values 3, 8, 11, and 12 are never applicable in this scenario.

For clarity, to illustrate, when the input corresponds to the decimal value 7, the respective binary configuration of a, b, c, and d would be set to 0, 1, 1, 1. My goal is to derive the digital logic expressions for this system in two specific forms: I need to formulate the output, out_sop, in the canonical Sum of Products (SOP) form and also produce the output, out_pos, expressed in the canonical Product of Sums (POS) form, while ensuring both are minimized.

Given these requirements, could you clarify the best approach for determining the minimal expressions for out_sop and out_pos? What considerations should I keep in mind regarding the given input-output combinations in order to achieve this? Additionally, what methodologies or logical approaches are typically employed in such scenarios to derive and simplify these expressions effectively?
