As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, your current project involves designing a critical Verilog module that forms an essential component of a next-generation product. This project is particularly important, as the successful implementation of this module is crucial to uphold the companyâ€™s esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

In the context of this task, your objective is to construct a combinational circuit that takes two inputs, denoted as 'a' and 'b'. This circuit will generate seven outputs, each of which will be driven by specific logic gate operations. The outputs you are required to design include the following:

1. **out_and**: This output should reflect the logical conjunction (AND operation) of inputs 'a' and 'b'.
2. **out_or**: This output is the result of the logical disjunction (OR operation) of the two inputs 'a' and 'b'.
3. **out_xor**: For this output, you need to implement the exclusive OR operation, which outputs true when either (but not both) of the inputs are true.
4. **out_nand**: This output should represent the negation of the AND operation (NAND), meaning it should output true unless both 'a' and 'b' are true.
5. **out_nor**: Conversely, this output should depict the negation of the OR operation (NOR), resulting in true only when both 'a' and 'b' are false.
6. **out_xnor**: For this output, you are tasked with implementing the exclusive NOR operation, which yields true only when both inputs are the same.
7. **out_anotb**: The final output should show the result of the AND operation where 'a' is true and 'b' is false, commonly referred to as "a and-not b."

To encapsulate this information, you will create a Verilog module called 'top_module' that will include the appropriate input and output specifications. The structure of the module will be defined as follows, allowing for the insertion of the necessary code to achieve the desired functionality. 

The code snippet provided outlines the initial framework of your module, but it requires your expertise to fill in the specific logic that will govern the outputs. Please refer to this foundational structure as you embark on the implementation process.
