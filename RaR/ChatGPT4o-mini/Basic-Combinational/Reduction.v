As a highly experienced Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been assigned the crucial task of creating a specific Verilog module that is essential for the functionality of an upcoming state-of-the-art product. The successful implementation of this module plays a vital role in preserving and enhancing the reputation of your company within the competitive landscape of computer hardware. 

One of the fundamental operations necessary for ensuring data integrity during transmission over potentially unreliable communication channels is parity checking. In this context, you are required to conceptualize and develop a digital circuit responsible for calculating a parity bit corresponding to a given 8-bit byte. This calculation will add an additional 9th bit to the byte, allowing for enhanced detection of errors.

Your project will focus on constructing a module that specifically employs "even" parity. The mechanism for determining the parity bit involves taking the XOR (exclusive OR) of all 8 data bits within the input byte. Therefore, the question at hand is: how would you design the Verilog module named `top_module`, defined with an 8-bit input named `in` and a single output for the `parity`, which effectively computes the even parity bit based on the 8 bits provided? 

In your design process, you should consider the precise logic needed to implement this XOR operation across the input data lines, resulting in a reliable output that meets the specifications of the even parity requirement.
