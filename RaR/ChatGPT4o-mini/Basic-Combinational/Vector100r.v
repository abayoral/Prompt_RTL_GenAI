As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the significant responsibility of creating a specific Verilog module that plays a crucial role in a next-generation product. The effectiveness and quality of this module are vital to upholding the esteemed reputation of your computer hardware company within the industry. 

The task at hand involves taking a 100-bit input vector, denoted as [99:0], and reversing its bit ordering. Essentially, this means that the most significant bit (MSB) of the input should become the least significant bit (LSB) of the output, and vice versa, such that the new output vector presents the reversed sequence of bits from the original input.

Considering the requirements of this task, think about how you might effectively implement the necessary functionality within a combinational always block. It seems pertinent to employ a for loop for this reversal operation, as it can streamline the process of accessing and reassigning the bits based on their index. However, be mindful of your preference to utilize a combinational always block specifically for this operation, as you have determined that using a generate block for module instantiation is not necessary in this context. 

With these guidelines in mind, please articulate the approach you would take to implement this functionality effectively within the provided module structure. What considerations will you take into account for ensuring that the design is not only functional but also optimized for performance and resource utilization?
