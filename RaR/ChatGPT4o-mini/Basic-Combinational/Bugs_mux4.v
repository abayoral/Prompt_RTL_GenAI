As a highly experienced Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the critical responsibility of developing a Verilog module that is essential for the success of a next-generation product. The effective functioning of this module is crucial, as it plays a significant role in upholding your company’s esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Your current task involves designing a 4-to-1 multiplexer, but it has come to your attention that the implementation is not functioning correctly and requires debugging. Within the provided code, you have a fully operational 2-to-1 multiplexer module named `mux2`, which serves as a reliable reference design. 

To facilitate the development of the 4-to-1 multiplexer, named `top_module`, you are attempting to integrate multiple instances of the `mux2` module. The `top_module` takes a 2-bit selection input, along with four 8-bit input lines (labeled as a, b, c, and d), and is intended to produce an 8-bit output. 

Inside the `top_module`, you’ve instantiated two separate `mux2` modules named `mux0` and `mux1`, each designed to handle two of the four inputs based on the selection bits. Additionally, there exists a third instance, also referred to as `mux2`, which is meant to combine the outputs from the first two multiplexers to arrive at the final output. However, you have identified that the implementation currently contains errors that prevent it from functioning as expected.

Given this context, what specific issues or discrepancies can be inferred from the provided Verilog code that would lead to the malfunction of the 4-to-1 multiplexer? What debugging strategies or considerations should be taken into account to accurately identify and rectify these bugs? Your comprehensive understanding of Verilog and digital design principles will be crucial in tackling these challenges effectively.
