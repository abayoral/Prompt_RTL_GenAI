As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the critical task of creating a Verilog module for an upcoming product that is essential to your company's reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry. The module needs to process a four-bit input vector specified as 'in[3:0]'. 

In this context, I would like to clarify the requirements tied to this task by breaking down the expected outputs based on the relationships between each bit of the input vector and its neighboring bits.

1. For the output vector called 'out_both', how should we determine the value of each bit in this vector based on the corresponding bit in the input and its immediate neighbor to the left (if one exists)? Specifically, can we outline the criteria for when a bit in 'out_both' should be set to '1'? For instance, in the case of 'out_both[2]', it needs to reflect whether both 'in[2]' and 'in[3]' are '1'. Additionally, given that 'in[3]' doesnâ€™t have a left neighbor, what implications does this have for the last element of the output vector?

2. Moving to the 'out_any' output vector, what is the method for determining if any of the corresponding input bit or its immediate right neighbor is '1'? For instance, in the case of 'out_any[2]', what specific relationship must hold for either 'in[2]' or 'in[1]' to qualify this output bit as '1'? Additionally, since 'in[0]' does not have a right neighbor, how should we treat this edge case?

3. Lastly, when discussing the 'out_different' output vector, how do we ascertain whether a bit in this vector should reflect that the corresponding input bit is different from its left neighbor? Specifically, what logic should be applied for 'out_different[2]' in determining the inequality of 'in[2]' and 'in[3]'? Given the stipulation that the vector should be treated as wrapping around, how does this affect our evaluation for 'in[3]' where its left neighbor would be 'in[0]'?

I am seeking clarity and a deeper understanding of how to approach these relationships, focusing on the design implications of the required functionality as presented in the task description, without delving into specific coding solutions at this moment.
