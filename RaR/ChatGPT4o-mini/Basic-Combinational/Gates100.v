As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent company specializing in hardware design, you have been assigned a crucial task involving the creation of a Verilog module for a groundbreaking product. This module holds significant importance, as its successful implementation could greatly impact your company's reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

The designated task requires you to construct a combinational circuit that takes a total of 100 inputs, labeled as in[99:0]. From these inputs, your design must yield three specific outputs: 

1. out_and, which represents the result of a 100-input AND gate that combines all the input signals.
2. out_or, which is the output from a 100-input OR gate that aggregates the input signals.
3. out_xor, representing the output of a 100-input XOR gate that will yield a result based on the exclusive OR operation across all the input signals.

Given the scale and complexity of this design, it may be beneficial to utilize reduction operators within Verilog to efficiently implement these outputs.

Could you provide your thoughts and design strategies on how to approach the development of this Verilog module? Additionally, how do you plan to handle potential challenges during the design process, especially considering the critical nature of this module in relation to the overall success of the product and the reputation of your company in the industry? What design practices or methodologies do you think will be most effective in ensuring the functionality and reliability of the outputs?
