As a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned a critical responsibility that involves the development of a pivotal Verilog module for an upcoming product that is expected to play an essential role in upholding your company's esteemed position within the industry. 

Your objective is to design a digital circuit that takes in two 2-bit input vectors, designated as A[1:0] and B[1:0]. The circuit needs to evaluate these inputs and produce a singular output, labeled z. The specific requirement is that the output z should yield a value of 1 if, and only if, the two input vectors A and B are identical (i.e., A equals B). Conversely, in cases where the two input vectors differ, the output z should reflect a value of 0. 

With this information in mind, can you clarify the necessary steps or considerations involved in implementing this logic within a Verilog module? Additionally, are there particular design methodologies, best practices, or optimization techniques that you should keep in mind to ensure that the module not only meets the functional requirements but also adheres to industry standards for efficiency and performance? 

Also, how might any potential edge cases or nuances in the comparison process be addressed in your design to ensure the robustness and reliability of the final output? What testing or verification strategies would be appropriate to validate the functionality of this module effectively before deployment in the next-generation product?
