As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design organization, you have been assigned the responsibility of creating a crucial Verilog module, which is essential for the success of a next-generation product. This module will play a vital role in reinforcing your company's standing and reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry. 

The task at hand involves designing a specific digital circuit component: an XNOR gate. To clarify, an XNOR gate produces a true output (logic high) only when the number of true inputs is even—meaning it will output true when both inputs are the same (either both true or both false), and false otherwise. 

Your challenge is to construct a Verilog module that accurately implements this functionality. Given that the bitwise-XOR operator is denoted by ^, it is important to note that there is no explicit logical-XOR operator available for your use in this context. 

In your module definition, you are asked to create a structure titled "top_module," which requires two input ports—designated as 'a' and 'b'—and one output port referred to as 'out.' As part of your solution, you will be responsible for inserting the necessary code to create the desired logic. 

To summarize, your task involves:
1. Understanding the fundamental operation of an XNOR gate.
2. Implementing this operation in Verilog using the available operators.
3. Ensuring that the design meets the specifications required for it to function within the broader context of the next-generation product you are developing.

With these considerations in mind, what are the key steps you would take to effectively construct this XNOR gate module in Verilog?
