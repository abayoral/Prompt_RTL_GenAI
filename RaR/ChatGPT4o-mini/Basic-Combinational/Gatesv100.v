As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you’ve been entrusted with the critical task of developing a Verilog module that plays an essential role in a next-generation product. This module is integral to the project's success and is vital for upholding your company's reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Your focus is on processing a 100-bit input vector denoted as `in[99:0]`. The challenge consists of determining specific relationships between each bit in this vector and its immediate neighbors. 

1. **For the `out_both` vector**: You are required to create an output that captures instances where both the input bit and the bit to its left are equal to '1'. For instance, the bit `out_both[98]` will represent the condition of both `in[98]` and `in[99]` being '1'. It is important to note that since there is no left neighbor for `in[99]`, the computation for `out_both[99]` is not necessary.

2. **For the `out_any` vector**: The output generated here will indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its right neighbor are '1'. For example, `out_any[2]` will reflect if either `in[2]` or `in[1]` is '1'. Similar to the above point, since `in[0]` lacks a neighbor to the right, `out_any[0]` will also be excluded from the output.

3. **For the `out_different` vector**: This output will show whether the corresponding input bit is distinct from its left neighbor. For example, `out_different[98]` should convey whether `in[98]` differs from `in[99]`. It’s critical to bear in mind that for this specific output, the vector wraps around, meaning that `in[99]` is considered to have `in[0]` as its left neighbor.

Considering these requirements, the objective is to implement the logic necessary to create the `out_both`, `out_any`, and `out_different` output vectors, using a concise approach that can be effectively executed in just three assignment statements within the module. 

Could you elaborate on the specific functionality and relationships that need to be established between the input bits and their neighbors, including the implications of the wrapping condition for left neighbors? Additionally, it would be useful to detail any constraints or considerations for optimizing the module’s design while maintaining clarity and coherence in the output representations.
