As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the important task of developing a Verilog module that is crucial for a next-generation product. The successful completion of this module is essential for safeguarding your companyâ€™s reputation within the highly competitive computer hardware industry. 

In your current Verilog code, you have noticed that there are issues leading to unintended latch formation, which could jeopardize the system's intended functionality. Specifically, there are two key behaviors that need to be addressed:

1. The module must ensure that the computer only shuts off when it is genuinely determined to be overheated, rather than any other spur-of-the-moment conditions.
2. The control logic should prevent ongoing driving under two specific conditions: when the vehicle has reached its destination, or when there is an immediate need to refuel due to an empty gas tank.

Your task is to analyze the provided Verilog code snippet to identify the technical flaws that lead to the creation of a latch and rectify them accordingly. The current structure does not reflect the desired state machine logic for controlling the shutdown and driving functionality based on the specified inputs. 

Could you please elaborate on the specific areas in the code that are contributing to these incorrect behaviors, and what considerations should be made to accurately implement the logic required for the intended outcomes? Additionally, how will you ensure that the changes adhere to best practices in digital design and avoid introducing new issues?
