As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you are currently responsible for the development of a crucial Verilog module that is essential for a next-generation product. The performance and reliability of this module play a significant role in upholding your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

To better understand the context, there is an existing issue with a three-input NAND gate implementation that is not functioning as expected. Your task involves identifying and rectifying the underlying bugs or errors present in the module's Verilog code. 

Additionally, it's noteworthy that you are required to utilize a provided 5-input AND gate in your design, which adds another layer of complexity to the problem. 

With this in mind, could you clarify what specific errors or shortcomings you have encountered in the implementation of the three-input NAND gate? Furthermore, can you elaborate on how the existing code utilizes the 5-input AND gate and its role in the design? What are the expected inputs and outputs for the NAND gate in this scenario, and how do you envision integrating the AND gate to achieve the desired NAND functionality? Please provide a detailed overview of the situation so that we can collaboratively pinpoint the issues at hand.
