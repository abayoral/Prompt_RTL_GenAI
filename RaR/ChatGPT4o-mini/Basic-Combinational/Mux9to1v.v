As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, I have been assigned the critical task of creating a Verilog module that is essential for the development of a next-generation product. The successful implementation of this module is integral not only to the project at hand but also to the overall reputation and standing of our company within the competitive landscape of computer hardware. 

The specific requirement of the module is to develop a 16-bit wide multiplexer that can select one of nine possible inputs—identified as a through i—depending on the value of the selection signal, `sel`. When `sel` is equal to 0, the output should correspond to input `a`; if `sel` is 1, then output `b` should be selected, and so on through to `sel` equal to 8, which should output `i`. However, there are some unused cases that need to be addressed: when `sel` is set to any value from 9 to 15, the expectation is that all output bits should be set to logic high, '1'.

Given the numerous input options, the design seems to lend itself well to organization using a case statement, which could allow for clear and maintainable selection logic. 

Could you elaborate on your thoughts regarding the structure of the Verilog module to ensure correct functionality? Furthermore, what considerations should be made regarding the implementation of the multiplexer, specifically in terms of handling the output cases for `sel` values greater than 8 while maintaining the integrity of the module's performance and reliability? Additionally, what coding practices or methodologies do you recommend for managing clarity and efficiency within the module's design?
