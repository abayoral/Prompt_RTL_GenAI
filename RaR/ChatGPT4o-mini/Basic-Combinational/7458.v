As a senior Digital Design Engineer working for a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned the critical task of developing a specific Verilog module that emulates the functionality of the 7458 chip, which incorporates four AND gates and two OR gates. The successful implementation of this module is essential not only for the immediate project but also for preserving the esteemed reputation of your company within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Your module's design must accommodate 10 input signals and produce 2 output signals, ensuring that it effectively replicates the logic operation of the 7458 chip. In this context, you have the option to utilize either assign statements to directly drive each of the output wires or to define four intermediate wires that will serve as conduits for the outputs from the AND gates. This flexibility in design allows for exploration of different coding approaches, and you are encouraged to implement both methods for practice.

The design challenge specifically asks for the module to drive two output signals, named p1y and p2y, based on the provided input signals. The inputs consist of p1a through p1f for the first output and p2a through p2d for the second output. 

Can you provide a comprehensive Verilog module that not only mirrors the functionality of the 7458 chip but also demonstrates the use of both design techniques mentioned? Additionally, how will you approach the problem to ensure that the logic is correctly implemented while optimizing for clarity and maintainability in your code? Please detail the structure of your module, the choice of inputs and outputs, and the reasoning behind your approach.
