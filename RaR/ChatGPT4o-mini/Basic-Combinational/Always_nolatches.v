As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, your expertise is crucial in the development of a key Verilog module for an upcoming product that holds great importance for the firm's standing in the competitive landscape of computer hardware. 

To clarify the task at hand, you are currently focused on constructing a digital circuit that processes scancodes derived from a PS/2 keyboard, specifically for a gaming application. Your goal is to determine whether any of the four arrow keys—the left arrow, down arrow, right arrow, or up arrow—has been pressed by analyzing the last two bytes of scancodes received from the keyboard.

The scancodes you're working with are represented as 16-bit values, and they have a specific mapping to the respective arrow keys as follows: 
- The scancode `16'he06b` corresponds to the left arrow key,
- The scancode `16'he072` indicates a press of the down arrow key,
- The scancode `16'he074` represents the right arrow key,
- The scancode `16'he075` is associated with the up arrow key.
For scancodes that do not match any of these values, the output should reflect that no arrow key is pressed.

It's essential that your circuit has a 16-bit input for the scancode and produces four outputs: one for each of the arrow keys. You will implement this functionality using either a case statement or an if-elseif construct that recognizes the specific scancodes and asserts the corresponding output for the pressed key.

Moreover, to prevent the creation of latches within your design, it is crucial to ensure that every output has a defined value under all potential conditions. This means that you cannot simply rely on a default value for the outputs; rather, you must explicitly assign values for each of the four outputs in all scenarios, including both the recognized cases and the default case. 

To streamline this process and limit redundancy in your code, a recommended approach could be to initialize the output values to a default state prior to evaluating the conditions in a case statement. For instance, you might establish a block that initializes the outputs—setting all outputs to zero—before proceeding to apply cases that will modify these outputs based on the received scancode.

As you embark on writing the Verilog code for this module, consider the implications of your design choices and the monitoring of scancodes as you ensure that the circuit accurately reflects user input from the PS/2 keyboard. How will you structure your logic to facilitate clarity and maintainability in the code, and what considerations will you take into account to meet the performance and reliability standards expected for this critical component of the product?
