As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer working for a prominent hardware design firm, you are currently on an essential project aimed at creating a Verilog module that plays a crucial role in a next-generation product. The successful completion of this module is critical for preserving and enhancing your company's reputation within the competitive landscape of computer hardware design.

In this context, you are presented with a Karnaugh map that outlines how various inputs relate to the desired output configuration of the circuit. Your challenge involves designing the circuit implementation specifically leveraging one 4-to-1 multiplexer along with an appropriate number of 2-to-1 multiplexers, ensuring that you utilize the least amount necessary while adhering to certain constraints. Notably, you may not incorporate any additional logic gates beyond those provided by the multiplexers. Furthermore, you are required to use the variables 'a' and 'b' as the selector inputs for the 4-to-1 multiplexer, which is a design consideration that you must carefully integrate into your implementation strategy.

The specific task at hand requires you to focus exclusively on the section labeled "top_module," which is where you will implement the logic that derives from the provided Karnaugh map. The K-map is structured as follows, with each cell corresponding to a unique combination of input variables, where 'c' and 'd' are other input variables that may influence the outputs:

|       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|
| c'd'  | 1    | 0    | 0   | 1   |
| c'd   | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0   |
| cd    | 1    | 1    | 1   | 0   |
| cd'   | 1    | 1    | 0   | 1   |

As part of your responsibilities, you must devise a solution that effectively maps the output to this K-map configuration within the Verilog module designated as "top_module." The module must accept 'c' and 'd' as inputs while defining an output variable termed 'mux_in,' which consists of four bits to accommodate the necessary input connections to the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

Given this framework, what specific logic will you utilize within your module to encapsulate the functionality expected of it, considering the limitations and requirements laid out, particularly with regard to the types of multiplexers being employed and their configuration?
