As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you are faced with the responsibility of developing an essential Verilog module that contributes to the advancement of a next-generation hardware product. This module's performance is crucial for sustaining your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry. 

In this context, could you elaborate on how to create an AND gate using two distinct methodologies in Verilog? Specifically, could you explain how to implement this functionality utilizing both an assign statement and a combinational always block? Your response should detail the requirements and characteristics of each approach, including the implications for signal assignment and potential use cases in the overall module design. Furthermore, consider how these methods may affect the synthesis and simulation of the module you are tasked with creating.

The provided module skeleton indicates that you have inputs `a` and `b`, along with outputs `out_assign` and `out_alwaysblock`. Please provide a thorough explanation of how you would go about inserting the necessary code in the designated area, while highlighting the differences in operation and scenario between the two implementations.
