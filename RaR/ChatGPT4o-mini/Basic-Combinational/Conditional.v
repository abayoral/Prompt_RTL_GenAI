As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a reputable hardware design company, you have been assigned the crucial task of developing a Verilog module that plays a vital role in a next-generation product. This product is highly anticipated in the market, making the success of this module essential for preserving the company's standing and credibility within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

Your specific challenge involves creating a 4-way minimum finder that operates on four unsigned 8-bit numbers, labeled as a, b, c, and d. The goal is to identify the smallest value among these four inputs using standard comparison operators. However, you are required to implement this functionality using a structured approach that involves constructing two-way minimum circuits utilizing the conditional operator, often referred to as the ternary operator.

In order to address this task, it is necessary to consider how you can effectively compose multiple two-way minimum circuits into a cohesive 4-way minimum circuit. Additionally, the use of wire vectors for intermediate results will be important for maintaining clarity and efficiency in your design. 

Could you elaborate on how you intend to define the architecture of this Verilog module, considering the following points:
1. What specific strategy will you employ to create the two-way minimum circuits?
2. How will you organize the data flow between the different components of the module to ensure accurate comparisons?
3. What considerations will you take into account regarding the representation of intermediate results, and how will wire vectors facilitate this process?
4. Can you outline your thought process for integrating the various components to achieve the final output of the minimum value among inputs a, b, c, and d? 

Your insights into these areas will be instrumental in guiding the successful implementation of this Verilog module.
