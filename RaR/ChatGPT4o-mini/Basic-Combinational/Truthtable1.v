As a senior Digital Logic Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you are currently focused on the development of an essential Verilog module for an advanced product. This module's performance and functionality are crucial for preserving your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive hardware industry.

You are working with a truth table that defines the behavior of a digital logic function characterized by three distinct inputs and a single output. This truth table comprises a total of eight rows, representing all the possible combinations of the three input variables, which are denoted as x3, x2, and x1. Corresponding to these inputs, the table also includes an output column that indicates the respective output value for each combination.

Upon analyzing the truth table data, it becomes evident that there are four specific input combinations that yield an output of '1,' while the remaining four combinations result in an output of '0.' The rows of the truth table are outlined as follows:

- Row 0 corresponds to the input combination (0, 0, 0) resulting in an output of '0.'
- Row 1, with inputs (0, 0, 1), also yields an output of '0.'
- Row 2 has the input configuration (0, 1, 0) producing an output of '1.'
- Row 3, defined by the input set (0, 1, 1), results in an output of '1.'
- Row 4 features the inputs (1, 0, 0) yielding '0.'
- Row 5 has inputs (1, 0, 1) which results in an output of '1.'
- Row 6, with inputs (1, 1, 0), leads to '0.'
- Finally, Row 7 represents the input combination (1, 1, 1) which provides an output of '1.'

Your task is to design a combinational logic circuit that accurately implements the function described in this truth table. You are guided by a hint that suggests one straightforward way to derive the circuit is by expressing the function in a sum-of-products form. In this context, "sum" refers to the logical OR operation, while "products" pertain to the logical AND operations. To fulfill this requirement, you should conceptualize the circuit as comprising one N-input AND gate for each row of the truth table that needs to match specific input conditions, followed by a single OR gate that aggregates the results from these AND gates to produce the desired output.

As an example, you should note that the output will be '1' if the input combination corresponds to any of the rows that yield a '1' output: Row 2, Row 3, Row 5, or Row 7. In particular, the conditions for Row 2 require that x3=0, x2=1, and x1=0, indicating that this requires a three-input AND gate to confirm this input state. Therefore, the solution necessitates the construction of four distinct AND gates, each corresponding to a row with an output of '1,' which will be consolidated by means of a four-input OR gate.

In your Verilog module, named `top_module`, you are tasked with defining the necessary inputs—x3, x2, x1—along with the output denoted by 'f.' Your objective is to implement the appropriate combinational logic that adheres to the truth table's specifications. What considerations should you make in writing the code for this module to ensure accurate functionality based on the provided requirements?
