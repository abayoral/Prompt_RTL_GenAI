As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been assigned the critical responsibility of developing a Verilog module that is integral to the functionality of a next-generation product. The efficacy of this module, specifically an 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer, plays a crucial role in upholding your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of computer hardware. 

With that said, there seems to be an issue with the current implementation of the multiplexer, as it is not performing as intended. The existing code for the module is as follows:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output out  );

    assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);

endmodule
```

What you need to consider now is what specific aspects of this code might be causing it to malfunction. Are the inputs being processed correctly according to the logic of a 2-to-1 multiplexer? Are there any potential issues with how the output is being assigned based on the select signal? How can you assess the behavior of the multiplexer under various input scenarios to identify potential logical flaws, and what debugging strategies might you employ to isolate and rectify these bugs? Furthermore, in the broader context, what are the implications of this module's performance on the overall product and the company's standing in the market?
