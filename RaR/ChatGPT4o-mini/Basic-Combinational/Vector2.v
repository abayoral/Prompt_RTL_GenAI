As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you are tasked with the critical responsibility of developing a Verilog module that is essential for the next-generation product being designed. The significance of this module cannot be overstated, as its successful implementation is crucial for upholding the reputation and standing of your company within the competitive landscape of the computer hardware industry.

The specific requirement of your assignment is to create a circuit that will reverse the byte ordering of a 4-byte word. To elaborate further, you need a design that takes a 32-bit input, which can be thought of as consisting of four 8-bit bytes, and outputs a 32-bit result where the order of these bytes is inverted. For example, if the input is represented as 'AaaaaaaaBbbbbbbbCcccccccDddddddd', the output should produce 'DdddddddCcccccccBbbbbbbbAaaaaaaa'.

In approaching this task, please consider that the Verilog language offers useful features such as part-select, which can be utilized on both the left and right sides of an assignment statement to achieve the desired transformation. Your module will need to be encapsulated within a top-level design structure, defined with appropriate input and output ports.

As you proceed with this design, think carefully about the best way to interpret the byte order, how to manipulate the individual bytes, and what assignment syntax will be most effective for achieving the goal of the byte reversal within the framework of Verilog programming. Remember, the successful implementation of this module is not only a technical challenge but also a determinant of the overall project success and your company's position in the market.
