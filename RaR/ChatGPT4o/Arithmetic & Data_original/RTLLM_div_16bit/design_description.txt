As a professional Verilog designer, your task is to design and implement a specific digital logic module using the Verilog hardware description language. The goal is to create a 16-bit divider module, named `div_16bit`, which performs a precise division operation utilizing combinational logic. 

In this module, you'll manage two key inputs: a 16-bit dividend and an 8-bit divisor. The logic aims to continuously extract and manipulate bits from the dividend in a manner similar to manual binary division techniques. 

Here's a breakdown of the requirements and functionality:

1. **Module Name and Ports**: 
   - The Verilog module should be named `div_16bit`.
   - It should have two input ports:
     - `A`: A 16-bit wide input representing the dividend.
     - `B`: An 8-bit wide input indicating the divisor.
   - It should also have two output ports:
     - `result`: A 16-bit wide output representing the quotient of the division.
     - `odd`: A 16-bit wide output representing the remainder after division.

2. **Combinational Logic**:
   - Utilize combinational logic to achieve the division so that the output updates with any changes to the input. This involves comparing portions of the dividend to the divisor and determining the quotient and remainder in multiple steps.

3. **Division Process**: 
   - Begin by extracting the higher-order bits of the dividend that match the bit width of the divisor (8 bits in this case).
   - Compare these extracted bits to the divisor:
     - If these bits are greater than or equal to the divisor, the corresponding bit in the quotient is set to 1. Otherwise, it's set to 0.
   - Compute the difference between these dividend bits and the divisor, which becomes the beginning portion of the remainder.
   - Concatenate the resultant remainder with successive higher-order bits from the remaining dividend bits and repeat the comparison and subtraction process until the entire dividend has been processed.
   - Output the final computed quotient and remainder.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Your implementation involves two always blocks within the module.
   - The first always block, a combinational logic block, triggers changes in the input values `A` and `B` and initializes or updates internal register variables such as `a_reg` and `b_reg`.
   - The second always block, also a combinational block, performs the iterative process of the division by repeatedly comparing portions of the dividend with the divisor and updating the quotient and remainder until completion.

Through the steps outlined above, you'll craft a complete Verilog implementation that provides a functional 16-bit divider using only combinational logic, suitable for integration into larger digital systems or simulations. This module will effectively calculate both the quotient and remainder for any given inputs within the specified bit-width constraints, offering versatility in numerous digital processing applications.
