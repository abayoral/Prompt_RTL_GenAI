As a senior Digital Design Engineer with extensive experience in the field, you are currently working at a top-tier hardware design firm, renowned for its cutting-edge innovations. Your current assignment involves the development of a critical Verilog module that will form part of a pivotal next-generation product. The performance and reliability of this specific module are crucial, as the product will play a significant role in solidifying and advancing the company's reputation within the competitive computer hardware industry.

Your design task is to construct a Verilog module that takes three inputs and produces four outputs. The functionality of this module is to act as a basic routing mechanism where each output is directly connected to one of the inputs like wires. Here is what you need to configure: input 'a' should route to output 'w', input 'b' should connect to output 'x', and also separately to output 'y', while input 'c' should feed into output 'z'. This module should efficiently handle these straightforward assignments.

Additionally, considering Verilog's capabilities, particularly its concatenation operator, the solution should be implemented in a way that not only meets the functional requirements but also maintains simplicity, readability, and optimal resource utilization. The challenge lies not just in implementing a working module but in doing so in a manner that aligns with best practices for high-performance digital design.

Below, you have a skeleton code of the module with placeholders where your implementation should be inserted. Your task is to fill in the appropriate logic to accomplish these input-output connections using the Verilog language. The use of the concatenation operator, { signal1, signal2, signal3, ... }, might offer a neat way to achieve the desired wiring effect compactly, but it's crucial to ensure clarity and correctness in the resulting module.

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, b, c,
    output w, x, y, z );

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Your design will contribute to ensuring the success of this key project, directly impacting the company's strategic market position.
