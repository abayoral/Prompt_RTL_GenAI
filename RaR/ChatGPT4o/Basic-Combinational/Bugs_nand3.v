Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company. Your current assignment involves developing a critical component that is essential for your company's next-generation product line. The component in question is a Verilog module and its correct functionality is crucial for preserving your company's esteemed reputation within the highly competitive computer hardware industry. 

You have been provided with the responsibilities of ensuring that the module operates flawlessly. However, there is an existing issue with a specific Verilog module designed to implement a three-input NAND gate, which is currently malfunctioning and not delivering the expected results.

Despite the error, you are required to resolve any bug(s) present in the module. There are constraints you need to work within, namely, the requirement to utilize a pre-defined 5-input AND gate in your solution. Below is the code snippet that you need to debug:

```verilog
module andgate ( output out, input a, input b, input c, input d, input e );

module top_module (input a, input b, input c, output out);//

    andgate inst1 ( a, b, c, out );

endmodule
```

Review the Verilog code thoroughly, taking into account the intended design and functionality of a three-input NAND gate, while considering how to successfully implement it using the provided 5-input AND gate. Identifying and understanding the misalignment between the functional requirement (a NAND gate) and the implemented logic (an AND gate) is crucial to solving the problem.

In essence, your task is to diagnose the issue within this Verilog code, understanding how the current setup diverges from the expected NAND gate functionality, and consider how you might correctly employ the 5-input AND gate to implement the logic of a three-input NAND gate. Ensure to maintain adherence to the constraints while considering potential modifications that align with the intended operation of a three-input NAND gate.
