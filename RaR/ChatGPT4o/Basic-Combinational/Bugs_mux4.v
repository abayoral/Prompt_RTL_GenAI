As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a premier hardware design company, you have been entrusted with the crucial task of developing a vital Verilog module, specifically a 4-to-1 multiplexer, which is instrumental for the advancement of a next-generation product line. This development effort is not just an ordinary project but holds significant weight as it is pivotal for upholding and enhancing your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of computer hardware design.

You are provided with an existing 4-to-1 multiplexer which does not currently function as intended. Your task is to identify and rectify any errors or issues present within this module to ensure its proper operation. To aid in this task, you have access to a reliable and fully functional 2-to-1 multiplexer module that you can leverage in your design.

The current implementation of the 4-to-1 multiplexer is structured as follows:

```verilog
module mux2 (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

module top_module (
    input [1:0] sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] out  
); //

    wire mux0, mux1;
    mux2 mux0 ( sel[0], a, b, mux0 );
    mux2 mux1 ( sel[1], c, d, mux1 );
    mux2 mux2 ( sel[1], mux0, mux1, out );

endmodule
```

Several points are laid out for your attention:

1. **Review the Declaration of Wires:** Examine the declarations of the wires `mux0` and `mux1`. Ensure they are appropriately defined to accommodate the data structures they are intended to carry. Are these wires correctly specified to handle 8-bit wide data expected in the application?

2. **Analysis of the Multiplexer Interconnections:** Analyze the interconnections and selection logic involved among the given inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and outputs. Is the selection control implemented such that the correct inputs are being routed to the outputs based on the `sel` signal?

3. **Utilization of 2-to-1 Multiplexer**: Consider how the provided functional 2-to-1 multiplexer could be better employed to achieve the desired 4-to-1 multiplexing functionality without operational failures.

4. **Logical Consistency and Signal Flow**: Investigate the logical flow of the module to assure that the multiplexing operation complies with the expected behavior and conforms to standard digital design principles. Are all paths logically consistent, leading to the correct output based on the selection inputs?

Your objective is to conduct a thorough analysis of the current Verilog code, diagnose any discrepancies or logical errors, and proceed to fix these bugs to enable a fully functional 4-to-1 multiplexer module. Given the project's significance to the company's market standing, achieving precision and reliability in your redesign is paramount.
