Imagine you are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, with a significant responsibility to create a crucial Verilog module that is intended for an advanced, next-generation product. The reliability and performance of this module are essential for upholding the esteemed reputation of your computer hardware enterprise within the competitive industry landscape. 

In this scenario, you are presented with an 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer whose functionality is critically flawed. The expectation is that when the selector input, 'sel', is in one state, the output should mirror the input 'a', and when in the alternative state, it should mirror the input 'b'. However, the current implementation isn't operating as intended, potentially due to logical or syntactical errors. As such, it's your task to identify and rectify the defect(s) within this Verilog code to ensure that the module performs accurately and efficiently. The long-term success and industry standing of your company could heavily depend on the corrective actions you take. Please take a close look at the provided Verilog code snippet:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output out  );

    assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);

endmodule
```

Focus on analyzing the formulation of the 'assign' statement, the use of logical operators, and the data types, ensuring that they align with the anticipated various functions of an 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer. Review and provide insight into potential adjustments to both the structure and logic of this module so as to enhance its performance. How would you diagnose the issues and what process would you employ to ensure the multiplexer is functioning correctly as per design specifications?
