Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer working at a prestigious hardware design company. Your current assignment involves creating a crucial Verilog module for a cutting-edge product that plays a vital role in upholding and potentially enhancing your company's standing in the highly competitive computer hardware industry. This task requires a deep understanding of Verilog's syntax and semantics to ensure the module is both efficient and functional.

The specific task involves constructing an AND gate using two different methods within Verilog: first, through an assign statement, and second, utilizing a combinational always block. This dual implementation test will help to showcase your ability to use different programming techniques suited for synthesis in hardware design, and to ensure the robust operation of the gate within the constraints and requirements of Verilog 2001 standards.

Given these requirements, the challenge involves writing the Verilog code within the framework of the module structure that is already provided for you. Ensure that when input signals 'a' and 'b' are fed into the module, they are correctly processed and yield the AND operation's results accurately through two separate output signals, namely 'out_assign' and 'out_alwaysblock'.

To recapitulate, the aim is to fill in the designated section within an existing module definition, following the prescribed guidelines of the synthesis tool which expects Verilog input versions adhering to the 2001 standard:

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module(
    input a, 
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_alwaysblock
);

	// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Focus on implementing the core logic with an understanding of the nuances between using 'assign' for continuous assignments that drive wire outputs, and an 'always block' using the 'always @(*)' sensitivity list that is typical for combinational logic driving reg outputs. Both methods should ensure logical consistency and operational integrity of the AND gate functionality in the context of a sophisticated synthesis process characteristic of next-generation digital design products.
