You are a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, tasked with a crucial and strategic project involving the creation of a Verilog module. This module is essential for the development of a next-generation product, and its success is critical to uphold your company’s prominence and reputation within the competitive field of computer hardware. Your responsibilities include implementing a digital circuit based on the specifications provided by a Karnaugh map. The Karnaugh map, or K-map, outlines the logic function to be implemented and includes a cell with a 'don't-care' condition, denoted by 'd'. This 'don't-care' condition permits flexibility, allowing you to choose the most advantageous output value for that cell to facilitate an optimal implementation.

Below is the Karnaugh map that details the logic function to be implemented:

|       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|
| c'd'  | d    | 0    | 1   | 1   |
| c'd   | 0    | 0    | d   | d   |
| cd    | 0    | 1    | 1   | 1   |
| cd'   | 0    | 1    | 1   | 1   |

Your task is to simplify this Karnaugh map before delving into coding the Verilog module. You should attempt to discover an optimal simplification using both the product-of-sums (POS) and sum-of-products (SOP) forms, taking into account that while absolute optimality in your simplification cannot be verified, it is possible to ascertain whether your reduction aligns equivalently with the original specifications. Furthermore, ensure that your translation from the simplified K-map to a circuit representation is precise and effective.

Here is the Verilog module template provided, which you are expected to complete with the implementation derived from your simplification process:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out  ); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Approach this task by considering both the technical and project management aspects; the significance of your implementation extends beyond technical accuracy to maintaining your organization’s esteemed position in the industry.
