Imagine you hold a prominent position as a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a renowned hardware design company. Your expertise is relied upon heavily, as you are tasked with an essential project: developing a crucial Verilog module for a revolutionary next-generation product. This particular module is of utmost importance, as its success could significantly influence your company’s standing and reputation in the fiercely competitive computer hardware industry.

The module you need to design, referred to as "Module A," is expected to execute a specific logical operation—essentially, the function needs to calculate `z` based on a bitwise expression of inputs `x` and `y`. Specifically, the desired operation is to compute `z` as `(x^y) & x`, where `^` and `&` signify bitwise XOR and AND operations, respectively, applied to the inputs `x` and `y`.

The task at hand is to construct the Verilog code necessary to implement this operation within a defined top module. You have been provided with a skeleton of the Verilog module, which includes the declaration of an input-output interface: `top_module (input x, input y, output z)`. Your responsibility is to incorporate the appropriate logic within this module to achieve the intended functionality.

The outcome of your work on this module is critical, and a great deal of attention to detail and precision is required to ensure it performs as expected. This challenge is not just a task but also a pivotal moment in your career, with broader implications for your company's position in the technological realm.
