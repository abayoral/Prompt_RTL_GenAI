// You hold the position of a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a renowned hardware design company. This organization is on the cutting edge of technology and has established a significant reputation for innovation and reliability in the field. You have been assigned a crucial task: to develop a Verilog module for an upcoming, next-generation product. The performance and reliability of this module are critical, as they play a key role in upholding and possibly enhancing your company's standing in the competitive computer hardware industry.

// Your specific task is to design a digital circuit. The requirements for this circuit are relatively straightforward: it must have no input signals and precisely one output signal. The core functionality of this circuit centers around the output, which must consistently provide a signal representing a logical high value, typically denoted as '1'. Whether the circuit remains idle or is actively engaged, this output should reliably signal a logic high state at all times, demonstrating both stability and adherence to specifications.

// The module should be structured in accordance with the following skeleton code:

```verilog
module top_module( output one );

    // Your code should be inserted here.
    // The goal is to ensure 'one' is always logically high.
    assign one = [fixme]; // The placeholder needs to be replaced to properly fulfill the requirement.

endmodule
```

// In this Verilog module, you are expected to define the logic that meets the specifications described. The placeholder `[fixme]` within the code is meant for you to insert the correct expression or value that will ensure the output 'one' remains at a logical high. It is crucial to devise a solution that is efficient, clear, and aligns with professional standards to reinforce the company's prestigious reputation through the successful implementation of this design.
