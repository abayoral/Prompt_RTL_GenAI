You are currently occupying the role of a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent and influential hardware design firm. As part of your responsibilities, you've been assigned a crucial project: the development of a Verilog module that is central to the innovation of a next-generation product. The performance and reliability of this module are essential for the company to uphold its esteemed standing and competitive edge within the computer hardware industry.

Your task involves determining the smallest value from a group of four given unsigned eight-bit numbers. These numbers are to be processed in a way that effectively identifies the minimum value, using only a series of logical operations. In this scenario, you will leverage the standard comparison operators, such as less than ('<'), to evaluate these numbers. 

The challenge requires you to utilize the conditional (or ternary) operator to construct two-way minimum circuits. Each small circuit should compare a pair of numbers to identify the lesser of the two. Sequentially or hierarchically combine these smaller circuits to achieve a composite design capable of handling four inputs, thereby creating a comprehensive four-way minimum circuit.

Consider employing wire vectors to store intermediate results, which will aid in organizing the logical flow and managing the data between different stages of your circuit. 

This module is to be encapsulated within a Verilog top module with the specified inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`), and a single output (`min`), which will ultimately reflect the minimum value. You are required to insert your logic to derive this output by expanding upon the template provided:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a, b, c, d,
    output [7:0] min);

    // Insert your code below
    // assign intermediate_result1 = compare? true: false;

endmodule
```

Focus on the structure of your comparisons and organization of intermediary steps within your code.
