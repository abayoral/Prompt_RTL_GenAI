As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, you have been assigned the crucial task of developing a Verilog module for an innovative, next-generation hardware product. This task is critical as the viability and reliability of this module are essential for the continued excellence and reputation of your computer hardware company within the competitive industry landscape.

The core of your task is to correctly implement the logic function 'f', which is represented in the provided Karnaugh map. This function is defined over four variables, x1, x2, x3, and x4, and requires you to carefully interpret each cell of the Karnaugh map to derive the minimized Boolean expression. The values represented in the map are as follows:

       |  x_1'x_2'  |  x_1'x_2  |  x_1x_2  |  x_1x_2'  |
-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
x_3'x_4' |      1       |      0       |      0       |      1      |
x_3'x_4  |      0       |      0       |      0       |      0      |
x_3x_4   |      1       |      1       |      1       |      0      |
x_3x_4'  |      1       |      1       |      0       |      1      |

Pay close attention to the order of the input bits x[4:1] as arranged in the Karnaugh map. The development and correct coding of this logic function are essential for synthesizing it efficiently in Verilog to ensure accurate operation within the overall hardware system. Your module should be structured with a clear 'input' for the 4-bit variable array [x4, x3, x2, x1] and a single 'output' representing the function 'f', as shown in the skeleton of the Verilog module provided below:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [4:1] x,
    output f
);
    // Insert your code here
endmodule
```

Analyze the Karnaugh map to derive the most optimized Boolean expression before writing the Verilog code that implements this function. Consider different methods to derive this expression, such as grouping ones in the map and simplifying the equation logically. Remember, achieving an optimal implementation that runs efficiently is key to the module's performance and ultimately to your company's success in this project.
