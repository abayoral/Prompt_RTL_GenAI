Contextualizing your role within the company, you are a senior Digital Logic Design Engineer employed at a prominent hardware design firm. Your current assignment involves developing a crucial Verilog module that is integral to the architecture of a next-generation product. The success of this module carries significant weight as it directly impacts the reputation and credibility of your computer hardware company within the highly competitive industry.

Your task revolves around implementing a combinational logic circuit based on a defined truth table. This truth table is for a function featuring three distinct input variables, labeled x3, x2, and x1, and results in a single output, labeled f. The table comprises eight rows, each representing one of the possible combinations of input values, namely all permutations of 0s and 1s for these three inputs. Out of these input combinations, four lead to an output of 1, while the remaining four combinations result in an output of 0.

The truth table is presented as follows:

| Row    | Inputs       | Output |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Number | x3  x2  x1   |    f   |
| 0      |  0   0   0   |    0   |
| 1      |  0   0   1   |    0   |
| 2      |  0   1   0   |    1   |
| 3      |  0   1   1   |    1   |
| 4      |  1   0   0   |    0   |
| 5      |  1   0   1   |    1   |
| 6      |  1   1   0   |    0   |
| 7      |  1   1   1   |    1   |

Your objective is to design a combinational circuit that accurately implements this truth table. The challenge is to translate the table into a logical circuit, ideally using a sum-of-products approach. In this context, a "sum" refers to the logical OR operation, and "products" refers to the logical AND operation. This method involves using one N-input AND gate for each input row that results in a 1 output, followed by an OR gate to aggregate these results. Specifically, the output should be 1 when the inputs correspond to rows 2, 3, 5, or 7, indicating the need for a 4-input OR gate to handle these conditions.

Given this information, your task is to write the Verilog code to define this module. The module should declare three inputs: x3, x2, and x1; and one output: f. The final implementation must utilize combinational logic to ensure that the output accurately reflects the specified truth table behavior. The placeholder in the Verilog module provided here needs your expert code to complete the implementation. This project is critical for the company and requires a precise and efficient design.
