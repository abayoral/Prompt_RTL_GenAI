As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been given a crucial task that plays a significant role in the development of a next-generation product line. This task requires you to design a Verilog module, which is fundamental to enhancing your company's standing and credibility in the competitive field of computer hardware engineering.

Your specific objective is to construct a digital circuit capable of reversing the byte order of a 4-byte (32-bit) word. This operation involves reordering the bytes in the input data such that the first byte becomes the last, the second byte moves to the third position, the third byte shifts to the second, and the last byte is repositioned as the first. The transformation can be visualized as follows: an input pattern of `AaaaaaaaBbbbbbbbCcccccccDddddddd`, where each letter represents a byte, should be reordered to produce `DdddddddCcccccccBbbbbbbbAaaaaaaa` as the output. 

Utilizing the Verilog programming language, you are to develop a module named `top_module`. This module will feature a single 32-bit input, designated as `in`, and produce a 32-bit output, termed `out`. The byte reversal process you implement should leverage Verilog's capability to perform part-select operations on both sides of an assignment, allowing for direct and efficient manipulation of specific byte sections within the word.

The skeletal structure of the module is provided below. Your task includes inserting the appropriate code to perform the byte reversal operation within this framework, ensuring the output correctly reflects the reversed byte order based on the described requirements. Here is the outline you're working with:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [31:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );

    //Insert your code here
    // assign out[31:24] = ...;

endmodule
```

Consider the implications this module will have, not just in terms of functionality, but also the potential impact on the companyâ€™s technological capabilities and market position. This challenge not only tests your technical skills in digital design and Verilog coding but also highlights your strategic role in driving innovation and quality within your organization.
