// As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned a high-priority project to develop an essential Verilog module for an innovative, next-generation product line. The performance and reliability of this module are crucial to ensuring the sustained reputation and competitive edge of your computer hardware company within the rapidly evolving tech industry landscape.

// Your specific task is to design and implement a module that accurately simulates the function of a NOT gate using Verilog. The module you create should effectively perform the logical inversion operation, where it takes a single input signal and outputs its complementary value. It's important to note that Verilog, much like the C programming language, offers two distinct operators for performing negation: the bitwise-NOT (~) and the logical-NOT (!). Given the context of this task which involves merely a one-bit operation, either operator will suffice.

// Begin by constructing a top-level module as outlined in the Verilog structure below, where you need to define the code that accomplishes the NOT gate functionality. Utilize the appropriate syntax and conventions of the Verilog language to ensure your module is composed efficiently and accurately within the boundaries of digital design best practices. 

module top_module( input in, output out );

// This is where your Verilog code should be inserted.
// Pay attention to the logic that correctly represents the NOT gate operation.
