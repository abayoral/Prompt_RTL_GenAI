Imagine you have been appointed as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a renowned hardware design company. Your main responsibility revolves around developing a highly crucial Verilog module that will be an integral part of an upcoming, cutting-edge product. The well-established reputation of your company in the hardware industry largely hinges on the success of this module, making it a project of utmost importance. 

Your task is to create a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux) using Verilog, designed to choose between two inputs, `a` and `b`. The conditions governing the selection are specific: the mux should output `b` if both selection signals, `sel_b1` and `sel_b2`, are simultaneously true. If either or both of these signals are not true, the mux should default to output `a`.

The development needs to be demonstrated in two distinct approaches:
1. Using continuous assignment statements, you are to create one version where the output is handled using direct assignments.
2. In another version, you should employ procedural code using an 'if' statement within an 'always' block. 

Your design must adhere to the Verilog 2001 standards, as specified in the synthesis directive. The module definition you've been provided includes the inputs: `a`, `b`, `sel_b1`, and `sel_b2`, as well as two outputs: `out_assign` (which will be handled by assign statements) and `out_always` (managed within procedural code). 

Your challenge is to correctly and efficiently implement these requirements within the `top_module`, ensuring the functionality aligns with the specified selection criteria, all while maintaining code readability and synthesis readiness.
