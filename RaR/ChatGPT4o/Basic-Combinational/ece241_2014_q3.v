Imagine you are working as a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a premier hardware design firm. Your current task involves crafting a pivotal Verilog module for an advanced generation productâ€”an endeavor crucial to upholding your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive field of computer hardware. 

In this task, you are provided with a Karnaugh map, a tool essential for simplifying Boolean expressions, and you are asked to derive a circuit. This circuit should exclusively utilize a single 4-to-1 multiplexer alongside an optimal number of 2-to-1 multiplexers. The challenge is to minimize the number of 2-to-1 multiplexers used, as they must be deployed sparingly, without resorting to any additional logic gates. The selection inputs for the multiplexers must be the variables 'a' and 'b', pre-defined as selectors for the 4-to-1 multiplexer you are instructed to use.

The Karnaugh map given is organized as follows, with rows and columns labeled by combinations of variables, representing output states:

|       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|
| c'd'  | 1    | 0    | 0   | 1   |
| c'd   | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0   |
| cd    | 1    | 1    | 1   | 0   |
| cd'   | 1    | 1    | 0   | 1   |

Each cell in the map corresponds to a combination of the input variables 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', and displays the output expected for those combinations. The goal is to use these given values to design the 'top_module' so that the entire circuit precisely aligns with the truth table illustrated by the Karnaugh map.

Your implementation task is confined to developing the 'top_module' part of the Verilog code, ensuring that when combined with the 4-to-1 multiplexer, the resulting synthesis will accurately reflect the logic specified by the Karnaugh map. The inputs 'c' and 'd' are your primary focus, as you prepare the input-to-output mapping in the 'mux_in' output array, which signifies the inputs to the multiplexers.

Here's the skeletal structure of the Verilog module that you need to flesh out:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input c,
    input d,
    output [3:0] mux_in
); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

In summary, your mission is to transform the given Karnaugh map into an efficient circuit design constrained by specific component usage and input selection criteria.
