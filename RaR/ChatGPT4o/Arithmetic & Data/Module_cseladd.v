As an experienced Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design enterprise, you are entrusted with the development of a crucial Verilog module for a cutting-edge hardware component. The performance and reliability of this module are of utmost importance, as they could significantly impact the standing and prestige of your computer hardware company within the competitive industry landscape.

Your current task revolves around leveraging the existing module `add16`, which is engineered to perform the addition of two 16-bit integers, incorporating a carry-in value to produce both a 16-bit output sum and a carry-out flag. In advancing the design, the objective is to strategically instantiate three separate instances of this `add16` module, effectively constructing a carry-select adder architecture. This will enhance computation efficiency for summing 32-bit numbers.

In addition to instantiating the adder modules, your design must integrate a custom-built 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer. This component is essential for accurately selecting and directing the correct sum and carry-out values as prescribed by the carry-select adder methodology.

Your implementation should adhere to the architectural schematic, ensuring that interconnections among the adder modules and multiplexing components reflect the diagrammatic instructions accurately. The provided `add16` module has the following declaration:

```verilog
module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );
```

Now, within the context of the provided `top_module`, your responsibility is to conceptualize and script the Verilog code that will achieve the desired function with 32-bit number addition capability. You have access to two 32-bit inputs `a` and `b`, and your design should yield a 32-bit output `sum`.

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);

// Craft your Verilog code implementation here, ensuring all requirements are met

endmodule
```

It's crucial that your solution demonstrates both robustness and efficiency, aligning with overall project goals and maintaining the company's reputation for innovation and excellence in the hardware design sector.
