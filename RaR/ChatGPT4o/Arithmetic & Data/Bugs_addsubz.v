You are serving as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a premier hardware design firm, where your current responsibility involves creating a pivotal Verilog module for an upcoming product line. The effective performance of this module is crucial to uphold your computer hardware company's esteemed reputation in the competitive industry. The module in question is an adder-subtractor circuit with an embedded functionality to check whether the output result equals zero, marked by a zero flag.

The current version of the adder-subtractor module is encountering issues and is not functioning as intended. Your task is to identify and address the bug(s) in the Verilog code so that the module performs accurately under various operational conditions. The module's description suggests a basic arithmetic operation switchâ€”an addition or subtraction dependent on the 'do_sub' control signal, along with the setting of the 'result_is_zero' flag based on the result. However, problems arise from its current implementation, and it is crucial to ensure that both logical operations (addition and subtraction) and the zero detection are performed reliably.

Given this context, could you review the provided Verilog code to identify and rectify the errors to ensure the module functions correctly? The code snippet is:

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module ( 
    input do_sub,             // Control signal to choose between addition and subtraction
    input [7:0] a,            // First operand of 8 bits
    input [7:0] b,            // Second operand of 8 bits
    output reg [7:0] out,     // 8-bit result of the chosen operation
    output reg result_is_zero // Boolean flag to indicate if result is zero
);//

    always @(*) begin
        case (do_sub)         // Check control signal to choose operation
          0: out = a+b;       // Perform addition if do_sub is 0
          1: out = a-b;       // Perform subtraction if do_sub is 1
        endcase

        if (~out)             // Check if the result is zero
            result_is_zero = 1; // Set zero flag
    end

endmodule
```

Please ensure that during your inspection, all edge cases are considered, particularly how the zero flag is determined and whether the current logic handles this correctly. Additionally, assess whether the synthesis and timing constraints are properly addressed given the specified Verilog input version.
