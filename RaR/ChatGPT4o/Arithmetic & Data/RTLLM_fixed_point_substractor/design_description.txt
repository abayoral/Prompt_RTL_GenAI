Envision a scenario where you are immersed in a project that involves designing digital systems using Verilog, with the latest dataset available to you being updated up to October 2023. Your specific expertise as a Verilog designer is indispensable as you embark on creating a specialized module. This module is designated to execute fixed-point arithmetic operations, focusing explicitly on the task of subtraction, with exacting adherence to a predetermined level of precision. This entails managing and accurately processing both the integer and fractional segments of the numerical values involved in the operation.

The module you are tasked with developing is to be named `fixed_point_subtractor`. Importantly, this module must be structured to be adaptable and customizable in relation to certain parameters that define the configuration of the data being handled. Among these parameters are `Q`, identifying the bit count allocated to represent the fractional portion of the fixed-point number, and `N`, which indicates the total bit width—which includes both integer and fractional parts—for the inputs and outputs involved in the operation.

In terms of the module’s interface, it will receive the following input operands:
- `a [N-1:0]`: This multidimensional array represents the first fixed-point input operand and is N bits in length.
- `b [N-1:0]`: Similarly, this represents the second fixed-point input operand, also encapsulated within an N-bit structure.

Upon execution of the subtraction operation within the module, the intended output is:
- `c [N-1:0]`: This output variable represents the resultant fixed-point value after subtraction, maintaining conformity with the N-bit configuration.

Internally, the module will utilize a temporary register for the subtraction process:
- `res [N-1:0]`: This register acts as a temporary storage to hold the preliminary subtraction result, permitting subsequent processing or refinement before finalizing the output.

In addressing the requirements of the task, there are several scenarios necessitating distinct handling:
- For scenarios where both input operands `a` and `b` share the same sign, the operation simplifies to a straightforward subtraction of their integer and fractional components. The resultant sign should match that of the operands.
- Conversely, when `a` and `b` have differing signs, a more nuanced approach is required:
  - If operand `a` is positive while operand `b` is negative, the computation transforms into an addition of their absolute values. Here, the sign of the resulting value depends on the relative magnitudes—if `a` is of greater magnitude than `b`, and vice versa.
  - On the other hand, if `a` is negative and `b` is positive, the same rule applies, where absolute values are added and the magnitude comparison determines the result’s sign.

Additionally, provisions must be made for scenarios wherein the subtraction results in zero. In such cases, it is imperative to actively set the sign bit to zero, thus ensuring the result accurately denotes a neutral value.

Throughout the design and implementation, the precision and accuracy of the subtraction operation are dictated by the parameters `Q` and `N`, ensuring that the subtraction not only produces correct outcomes but also upholds the precision requisite for fractional components along with the complete numeric outcome. 

Your role involves crafting a detailed Verilog code that efficiently implements these specifications for fixed-point subtraction, ensuring precision, proper handling of signs, and accurate representation of zero, while integrating the versatility of parameterized settings.
