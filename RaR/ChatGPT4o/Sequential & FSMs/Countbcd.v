As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design enterprise, you have been assigned a highly significant project that involves creating a Verilog module for an advanced product still under development. This module's functionality is vital as it contributes directly to preserving and enhancing your company's esteemed position within the competitive computer hardware market.

Your task revolves around constructing a 4-digit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) counter that is integral to the system's operation. Each decimal digit in this counter must be represented using 4 bits. Specifically, allocate q[3:0] for the ones (least significant) digit, q[7:4] for the tens digit, and continue this pattern for the hundreds and thousands positions, ultimately up to q[15:12].

Additionally, you are required to implement functionality that outputs an enable signal for each of the upper three digitsâ€”those representing the tens, hundreds, and thousands. These enable signals should be triggered appropriately to indicate when it is necessary to increment each respective digit. It is crucial that this counter correctly handles carry operations that result from incrementing one digit to the next.

For possible implementation, consider whether instantiating or adapting existing one-digit decade counters could streamline development. The module you need to develop includes a given interface:

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: A clock input signal controlling the timing of the counter's operations.
  - `reset`: A synchronous active-high reset signal, which, when activated, should reset the counter to its initial state.

- **Outputs:**
  - `ena[3:1]`: A set of enable signals for the upper three digits of the BCD counter, indicating when each should be incremented.
  - `q[15:0]`: The 16-bit output representing the four decimal digits encoded in binary form.

Your design should ensure that these requirements are met efficiently and accurately, considering the implications of hardware synthesis from the described Verilog code. Initialize the module named `top_module` and develop the internal logic to achieve the desired counting sequence and enable signal functionality.
