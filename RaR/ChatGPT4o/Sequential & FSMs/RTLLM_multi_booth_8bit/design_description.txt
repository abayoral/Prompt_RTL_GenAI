You have been trained on data that includes information available up to October 2023. As a task, you are asked to assume the role of a skilled Verilog designer, focusing on the development of a specific digital design project. Your mission revolves around implementing an 8-bit Radix-4 Booth Multiplier. The purpose of this multiplier is to compute the product of two 8-bit binary numbers, which are designated as inputs 'a' and 'b'. The implementation process should utilize the Booth algorithm, recognized for its effectiveness in digital systems dealing with signed number multiplication while minimizing the necessary additive operations.

In terms of design requirements, several key elements are specified:
- A clock signal, referred to as 'clk', is necessary for synchronizing the operations within your multiplier design.
- A reset signal, named 'reset', is intended to initialize the multiplier to a known stable state whenever required. This functionality is crucial for ensuring accuracy upon startup or under certain conditions that necessitate a reset.

The multiplier module is expected to generate two primary outputs:
1. The product 'p' which is a 16-bit wide output that results from the multiplication process. Considering Booth's algorithm and the given input sizes, the product must accurately express signed numbers, necessitating a 16-bit width.
2. A 'ready' signal, 'rdy', indicating the conclusion of the multiplication operation. When the 'rdy' signal transitions to 1, it signifies that the product 'p' is ready and the multiplication operation is complete.

For implementation, follow these detailed directions:
- Name the Verilog module as `multi_booth_8bit`.
- Base the module's operations on the positive edge of both the clock signal 'clk' and the reset signal 'reset'.
- Upon detecting the reset signal as high, proceed to extend both inputs 'a' and 'b' to 16 bits by repeating their most significant bit, which indicates the sign, across the upper 8 bits. This extension is crucial for preserving the integrity of signed arithmetic functions because Booth's method hinges upon the 2â€™s complement number system.
- Maintain and manage the operation flow of the Booth algorithm by using a 5-bit counter 'ctr', ensuring that its process doesn't exceed 16 cycles.
- In every operational cycle, barring when the reset is high, the multiplicand should be shifted one bit to the left, reflecting the Booth algorithm's modulation of bit alignments.
- Accumulate the multiplicand into the product 'p' whenever the Booth encoding scenario during the current cycle, identified by bits from the multiplier, requests an addition.
- After each cycle, increment the counter and, upon reaching the total of 16 cycles, mark the end of the process by setting the 'rdy' signal to 1, thus indicating the availability of the final product. 

Could you provide a comprehensive Verilog code that embodies the concept and details of this defined multiplication process?
