As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been assigned a crucial project: developing a Verilog module that will play an essential role in a next-generation product. Your task involves creating a D flip-flop module, a fundamental building block in digital circuit design, which is critical for the integrity and performance of the hardware your company produces. The quality and functionality of this module are vital for preserving and enhancing your company's esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry. Therefore, you must implement the Verilog code for this particular D flip-flop, ensuring it meets the required specifications and industry standards.

Here is the provided template for you to complete:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,  // Clock signal input that synchronizes the flip-flop's operation
    input in,   // Data input for the D flip-flop
    output out  // Output, which reflects the stored data when triggered by the clock
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

In this context, you are expected to handle the synthesis of this module, applying your expertise in digital design to ensure it functions correctly within the larger system. Your implementation should be robust and efficient, considering it will be a foundational component in cutting-edge technology.
