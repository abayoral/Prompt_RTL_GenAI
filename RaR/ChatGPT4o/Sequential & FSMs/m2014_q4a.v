As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, you have been entrusted with a significant task: to develop a crucial Verilog module that will form a foundational component of a next-generation product. This project is of utmost importance, as the successful implementation and functionality of this module are essential to sustain and enhance the reputation of your computer hardware company within the competitive industry landscape.

The specific task at hand involves implementing a D flip-flop, which is a fundamental building block used in various digital circuits for data storage and synchronization. A D flip-flop captures the value on its data input (d) and transfers it to its output (q) based on the presence of an enable signal (ena). The nuance in this task lies in acknowledging that this is to be implemented as a latch, meaning that it can generate specific warnings during synthesis, such as those in Quartus, related to an inferred latch. Understanding and addressing these warnings while ensuring the functional correctness of the D flip-flop is central to the task.

Your role requires you to carefully craft the Verilog code for this module. You must take into account the synchronous and asynchronous behavior typical of a D flip-flop and ensure that the signal transitions adhere to industry-standard practices in digital circuit design. The provided module, named `top_module`, has placeholders for the input signals `d` and `ena`, and an output signal `q`. Your challenge is to fill in the appropriate logic in the designated area to make this D flip-flop operational, ensuring it meets all design and performance criteria expected of a high-quality hardware component.
