Your task as a proficient Verilog developer is to construct a digital design module that utilizes the shift-and-add algorithm for multiplication, all crafted within the Verilog Hardware Description Language. The focus of this assignment is to develop an 8-bit multiplier module that adheres to the specific guidelines outlined below, leveraging the shift-and-add approach recognized for its straightforwardness and compatibility with digital logic designs.

**Module Details**:

The module you are tasked to create is named `multi_8bit`, and it is structured to handle two 8-bit input numbers and output their product as a 16-bit wide data signal. 

**Input Ports**:
1. **A [7:0]**: This input represents an 8-bit operand acting as the multiplicand. As the multiplicand, `A` is the number that will be repetitively incremented, contingent upon the corresponding bits in the multiplier.
2. **B [7:0]**: This input represents an 8-bit operand serving as the multiplier. Each binary digit (bit) in `B` determines whether the multiplicand `A` will be added to the current product. The decision to add is based on the high (1) state of a bit.

**Output Ports**:
- **product [15:0]**: The result of the multiplication operation is conveyed through this 16-bit output bus. This width is crucial, as it can accommodate every possible result from multiplying two 8-bit numbers, from the smallest product of 0x0000 (0 times any number) to the largest possible outcome of 0xFFFF (255 times 255), thus avoiding overflow and loss of significant data.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Multiplication Approach**: The core of this module involves examining each bit of the multiplier `B` via iteration. For every bit position in `B` that holds a value of 1, the multiplicand `A` is conditionally added to an accumulating total, which is thus modified in correspondence with that specific bit's positional weight in `B`. This approach is akin to performing traditional binary multiplication where aligned partial products are summed.
- **Shifting Logic**: This algorithm necessitates that after evaluating each bit of `B`, `A` undergoes a left shift. This logical operation essentially preps `A` for potential alignment adjustments in the subsequent bit examination, which is analogous to the systematic shift observed in typical paper-and-pencil multiplication.
- **Iterative Control Process**: The described operations suggest the need for iterative logic, systematically stepping through each bit position of `B`, assessing them, and proceeding with the corresponding shift and possible addition of `A` to the product, as dictated by the methodology.

Your mission is to translate this described process into accurate Verilog syntax, possibly including a clock-driven process for addressing any sequential operations. Additionally, ensure that input and output specifications are comprehensively met as per the module's defined requirements.
