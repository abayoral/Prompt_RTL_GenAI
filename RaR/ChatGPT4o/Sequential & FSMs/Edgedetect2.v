Imagine you are serving as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company known for pushing the boundaries of innovation in the computer hardware industry. Your latest assignment involves creating a critical Verilog module that is set to become an integral component of a highly anticipated next-generation product. The performance and reliability of this module are vital, as it plays a crucial role in upholding and enhancing the company's esteemed reputation within the competitive landscape of the technology sector.

The specific task at hand involves developing a mechanism within an 8-bit vector input system. For each individual bit within this 8-bit vector, your goal is to design a feature that can accurately detect changes in the input signal as they occur from one clock cycle to the next. Essentially, the module must identify any edge â€” specifically focusing on 0 to 1 transitions.

Once such a transition is detected, the design requires that the corresponding bit in the output vector, named 'anyedge', is to be set (or flagged) in the clock cycle immediately following the 0 to 1 transition. This output vector should, therefore, reflect any detected changes in the state of each bit within the input vector as these changes occur over successive clock cycles.

Given this context, you are tasked with completing the implementation of this functionality within the following Verilog module template:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] anyedge
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

This module currently exists as a skeleton, awaiting your expertise to bring it to full functionality in alignment with the outlined requirements. Your challenge involves writing the Verilog code necessary to effectively monitor and respond to these signal changes across the 8-bit input vector. Consider the synchronization with the clock and how you might track previous states to facilitate the detection of transitions. Your design must ensure accuracy while optimizing for performance and efficiency, keeping in mind the high stakes tied to the project's outcome.
