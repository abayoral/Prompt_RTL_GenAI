Imagine that you are an experienced Digital Design Engineer working at a top-tier hardware design company, where you have been entrusted with the critical responsibility of designing a Verilog module integral to an upcoming, cutting-edge product. Completing this module successfully is crucial to uphold the esteemed reputation of your computer hardware company within the industry.

Within your scope of work, you are dealing with a finite state machine (FSM) designed to accurately discern when bytes have been received correctly from a continuous stream of bits. This FSM is engineered to detect a start bit, subsequently track the reception of the 8 data bits, and finally verify the integrity of the stop bit. In the instance where the stop bit does not appear as anticipated, the FSM must enter a state of waiting until a correct stop bit is identified, before proceeding to process the next byte.

Now, your task expands beyond merely recognizing the integrity of bytes. You must integrate a datapath into this FSM that will enable the output of these correctly-received byte data. The data output through `out_byte` should only be considered valid when the `done` signal is asserted (i.e., when `done` is high), and under any other circumstances, the value of `out_byte` is considered irrelevant or "don't-care."

Crucially, it's important to remember that the serial protocol in use sends bits starting with the least significant bit first, implying a specific bit order that must be managed during processing. 

Consider that this byte information is streamed serially, and thus, the bitstream must be controlled—shifted in one bit at a time—and subsequently, converted to a parallel form to be effectively outputted. 

Given these requirements and context, your challenge is to adaptively manage this FSM and datapath within the constraints of Verilog, considering synchronous reset operations, in order to deliver a robust solution that fulfills the outlined task. The interface includes inputs for the clock (`clk`), data stream (`in`), and a reset signal (`reset`), while providing outputs of a byte (`out_byte`) and a completion signal (`done`).  

As you move forward to implement your design using the module template provided, make sure to utilize and possibly enhance the existing FSM code referred to as `Fsm_serial`, while you simultaneously devise a mechanism for the new datapath that will appropriately latch and output the incoming bits.
