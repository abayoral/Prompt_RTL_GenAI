As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prestigious hardware design firm, you have been assigned with the critical task of developing a Verilog module that is integral to the success of a next-generation product. This module's success is crucial for preserving your companyâ€™s distinguished reputation within the computer hardware industry. Specifically, you are tasked with designing a timer with a single input that operates according to a multi-step sequence. Here's a detailed breakdown of the requirements:

1. **Detection of Initial Pattern**: The module should monitor a serial data input for a specific binary pattern, "1101". Once this pattern is detected, it triggers the subsequent steps in the sequence.

2. **Receiving Additional Bits**: After the initial pattern is detected, the module should proceed to shift in the next four bits of data. These bits arrive most-significant-bit first and determine the timer's delay duration, stored as `delay[3:0]`.

3. **Counting Cycle Phase**: With the delay determined, the module enters a counting phase. The state machine should assert a `counting` output, signaling that the timer is actively counting. It must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. For example, if the delay is 0, it counts 1000 cycles; if the delay is 5, it counts 6000 cycles. The `count` output should show the current remaining time, decrementing every 1000 cycles from the initial delay value to zero.

4. **Completion Notification**: Once the counting phase completes, the module should assert a `done` signal, indicating the timer has expired. The system should then wait for an `ack` signal from the user before resetting and resuming its search for the "1101" pattern.

5. **Initial Reset State**: Upon initialization or reset, the circuit should enter a state where it actively searches for the input pattern "1101". 

Additionally, consider the implementation guidelines: it is permissible to construct this module in a single block as long as the distinct elements, such as detection, counting, and notification, are separated into individual `always` blocks within the module. This promotes clarity and reduces potential errors, enhancing readability and maintainability of the code.

Considering these specifications, outline the implementation within the provided module skeleton. The key inputs include `clk` for synchronization, a `reset` for initializing the state, and a `data` input to monitor for the pattern. The outputs include `count` for the countdown display, `counting` for the indication of an active count, `done` for signaling completion, and an `ack` input for acknowledging end of timer before reset. Plan the architecture of the state machine to handle these tasks effectively.
