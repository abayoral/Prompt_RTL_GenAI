You are currently employed as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm. Your main responsibility revolves around developing an essential Verilog module aimed at enhancing a next-generation product. The performance and functionality of this particular module are crucial, as they will significantly impact the reputation and reliability of your computer hardware company within the competitive industry landscape.

Your project entails designing a 4-bit binary counter, which should incrementally count from 0 up to 15, thus covering all 16 possible states in its counting cycle. The operation of this counter should have a periodicity of 16, effectively looping back to 0 after reaching 15. Furthermore, the counter must feature a reset input, which is synchronous, meaning the reset action should occur in sync with the clock signal. When activated with a high signal, this reset input must reset the counter back to 0, ensuring a predictable and reliable return to the initial state upon triggering.

The clock signal (clk) will serve as the primary timing mechanism for the counter's operation, while the 4-bit output (q) should dynamically represent the current state of the counter in binary form. The design requirements necessitate a focus on effective synchronization within the digital system to ensure the counter operates within the specified parameters.

In creating this Verilog module, you should consider any potential edge cases, such as how the counter behaves during simultaneous edge transitions and ensure robust handling of the synchronous reset mechanism. Given your expertise, the design should be both efficient and reliable, adhering to industry standards and best practices for digital circuit design.

    output [3:0] q
);

// You are tasked with implementing the necessary code logic here.

In this context, you will need to define the behavior of this module in Verilog, considering the interaction between the clock, reset signal, and output. Your approach should reflect an optimal balance between simplicity and performance while maintaining comprehensive coverage of all operational scenarios.
