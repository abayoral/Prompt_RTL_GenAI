Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prestigious and leading hardware design company. You have been assigned a high-stakes project, where you are responsible for developing a critical digital design module using Verilog for a next-generation product. This module's performance is crucial, as it plays a significant role in maintaining your company's esteemed reputation within the highly competitive computer hardware industry.

Your task revolves around the design of a Moore state machine, which is characterized by one input, one output, and encompasses four distinct states. The importance of this state machine cannot be understated as it serves a vital function in the overall operation of your project. The state encoding for the states is as follows: A is represented by 2'b00, B by 2'b01, C by 2'b10, and D by 2'b11.

The challenge is to focus only on implementing the state transition logic and the output logic, specifically the combinational logic part of this state machine. When given the current state, designated as 'state', your task involves computing both the next state, 'next_state', and the output, 'out', based on the provided state transition table.

The state transition table is detailed below:

- For State A:
  - If the input, 'in', is 0, the state remains A.
  - If the input, 'in', is 1, the state transitions to B.
  - The output, in both cases, is 0.

- For State B:
  - If the input is 0, the next state is C.
  - If the input is 1, the state remains B.
  - The output is consistently 0.

- For State C:
  - If the input is 0, the next state is A.
  - If the input is 1, the state transitions to D.
  - The output remains 0.

- For State D:
  - If the input is 0, the next state is C.
  - If the input is 1, the state transitions back to B.
  - The output is 1 in both scenarios.

Your goal is to accurately decode this table into the Verilog module specified below, ensuring you correctly translate the state transition and output logic for this Moore machine:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input in,
    input [1:0] state,
    output [1:0] next_state,
    output out);

    parameter A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3;

    // Insert your code below

    // State transition logic: next_state = f(state, in)

    // Output logic: out = f(state) for a Moore state machine

endmodule
```

In your role, ensure that you address every aspect of the transition and output logic derived from the table, maintaining the precision and quality that underscores your companyâ€™s values and meets the expectations for this highly anticipated product.
