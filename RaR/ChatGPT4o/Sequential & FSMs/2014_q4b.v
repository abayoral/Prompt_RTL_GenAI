As a senior Digital Design Engineer specializing in hardware design, you have been assigned an important project to develop a crucial Verilog module for an innovative next-generation product at your renowned hardware design company. This Verilog module is particularly significant as its performance and reliability are critical to maintaining your company's esteemed reputation within the competitive hardware industry. 

Specifically, your task is to design a top-level Verilog module named `top_module` for implementing a shift register. For this design assignment, it is specified that the shift register should have a length, denoted as `n`, equal to 4. This implies that the shift register will manage 4 bits of data. In the construction of this top-level module, you are required to instantiate four separate copies of a previously defined subcircuit named `MUXDFF`. This subcircuit will play a pivotal role in your design, yet the internal details or implementation specifics of `MUXDFF` itself are not provided and will need to be defined as part of your work.

Additionally, the design needs to be compatible with the DE2 board, a common piece of development equipment in digital design. The following connections are specified for interfacing your module with the DE2 board:

- Connect the R inputs to be controlled by the switches, designated as `SW`.
- The system clock, `clk`, should be linked to `KEY[0]`.
- The enable signal, `E`, is linked to `KEY[1]`.
- The load signal, `L`, is connected to `KEY[2]`.
- Finally, `w` (the write or data input) must be connected to `KEY[3]`.

Moreover, the outputs of your module should be directed to the red LEDs on the board, specifically `LEDR[3:0]`, allowing for a visual representation of the shift register's state. The design needs to integrate user input from the switches and keys, process these inputs through the shift register logic, and display the resultant output on the LED lights.

Your task is to fill in the details of the `top_module`, ensuring it correctly links with the four instances of the `MUXDFF` as required, and define the logic and behavior of the `MUXDFF` subcircuit to appropriately handle the shift register operations.
