This module performs division through combinational logic by iteratively constructing the quotient and remainder as it processes each bit of the dividend. The `always` block here ensures that every time inputs `A` and `B` change, we recompute the quotient and remainder instantly. The module performs a bit-wise binary long division, similar to how manual division is done by handling bit manipulation directly.
