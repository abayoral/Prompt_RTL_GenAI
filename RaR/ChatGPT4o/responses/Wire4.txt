```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, b, c,
    output w, x, y, z );

// Assign inputs to outputs as specified
assign w = a;
assign x = b;
assign y = b;
assign z = c;

endmodule
```

This Verilog module follows the specifications provided, connecting each of the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` to the desired outputs `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` directly. This approach ensures simplicity, readability, and directness in routing the signals.
