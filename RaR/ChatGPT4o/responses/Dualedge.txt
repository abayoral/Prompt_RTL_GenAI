```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    reg q_pos, q_neg;

    // Positive edge triggered flip-flop
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    // Negative edge triggered flip-flop
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    // Logic to combine results on both edges
    always @(*) begin
        q = clk ? q_neg : q_pos;
    end

endmodule
```

In this design, two separate flip-flops handle the positive and negative edges of the clock signal separately. One stores the value on the positive edge (`q_pos`), and the other on the negative edge (`q_neg`). The output `q` is then selected based on the current state of the `clk`. If `clk` is high, the value from the negative edge (`q_neg`) is presented; if `clk` is low, the value from the positive edge (`q_pos`) is shown. This configuration effectively mimics a dual-edge triggered flip-flop by combining the outputs of the two edge-triggered flip-flops.
