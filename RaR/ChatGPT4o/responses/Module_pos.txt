Note: In the code provided, `mod_a` is instantiated within `top_module`, and its ports are connected to the corresponding ports of `top_module`. The instantiation of `mod_a` is assumed to use named port connections to maintain clarity in port mapping, ensuring that each top-level port aligns correctly with each modular port by the order specified.
