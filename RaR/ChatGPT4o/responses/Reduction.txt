```verilog
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,   // Represents the 8-bit input data from which parity is to be computed
    output parity     // The calculated parity bit that ensures even parity for the entire 9-bit sequence
); 
    // Compute the even parity bit as the XOR of all the input bits
    assign parity = ^in;  // The reduction XOR operator in Verilog computes even parity
