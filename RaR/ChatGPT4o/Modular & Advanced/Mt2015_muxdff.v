Imagine you are occupying the role of a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, where your current responsibility includes the development of a crucial Verilog module for an innovative next-generation product. The functionality and performance of this module are vital, not only for the success of the product but also for the ongoing renown and competitive standing of your computer hardware company within the industry.

Now, consider the specific task at hand: you are to conceive and implement hierarchical Verilog code for a sequential circuit. This entails utilizing three instances of a particular submodule, each incorporating a flip-flop and a multiplexer. Such a design is intended to handle specific logic or processing tasks crucial to the systemâ€™s operation. The question poses the challenge of writing the Verilog module definition for this submodule.

Here is the starting point of the Verilog module you need to complete:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,   // Clock signal to synchronize operations
    input L,     // An input signal possibly used for controlling the multiplexer
    input r_in,  // An input that may represent a reset or another control signal
    input q_in,  // Another input whose role could be part of data processing or control
    output reg Q // Output that stores the result after processing through flip-flop and mux
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Your task is to flesh out the necessary code within the 'top_module' framework that accomplishes the intended sequential processing function. The module involves using a flip-flop to store state and a multiplexer to select between different inputs or paths within the data flow. Keep in mind the hierarchical nature of your final design, as you will eventually integrate this module as a building block within a more complex system that includes three such instances. Note that the module must operate synchronously with the clock signal ('clk') and account for different input control signals ('L', 'r_in', 'q_in') to determine the necessary operations or data path selections.
