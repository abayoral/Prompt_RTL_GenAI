You have been assigned the task of creating a complete Verilog code implementation for a design module called `synchronizer`. The core responsibility of this module is to function as a multi-bit multiplexer-based synchronizer, which operates by using a multiplexer to synchronize data across different clock domains. The module's primary purpose is to reliably process and propagate a multi-bit data input, referred to as `data_in`, ensuring that it remains unchanged whenever a specific control signal, `data_en`, is active. This control signal, `data_en`, must remain active (high) for no less than three sequential cycles of a particular clock, `clk_b`, to achieve proper synchronization.

Important Aspects to Focus On:

1. **Clock Domains**:
   - The design involves two separate and distinct clock signals, labeled `clk_a` and `clk_b`.
   - `clk_a` governs the timing for the incoming data (`data_in`) and the synchronization control signal (`data_en`).
   - `clk_b` oversees the timing for the delay of the control signal and the synchronization of the final output data (`dataout`), along with the relevant internal operations.

2. **Data and Control Signals**:
   - The signal, `data_in`, represents a multi-bit data input (consisting of 4 bits).
   - The signal, `data_en`, is used to determine when the data should be synchronized across the different clock domains.

3. **Synchronization Process**:
   - The control signal `data_en` is subjected to a defined propagation delay equivalent to two clock cycles, achieved using a pair of D flip-flops, which are synchronized to `clk_b`.

4. **Reset Operations**:
   - Two asynchronous reset signals are employed: `arstn` for operations within the `clk_a` domain and `brstn` for the `clk_b` domain, with both resets being active-low. An active-low reset indicates that the respective registers and operations within a domain are reset or initialized when the reset line is low.

5. **Module's Functional Behavior**:
   - In the `clk_a` regime, there is a data register named `data_reg` used to store the `data_in` signal. The update of its state hinges on the enable signal, regulated by `clk_a`. 
   - Another register, `en_data_reg`, stores the state of `data_en` under similar conditions.
   - Within the `clk_b` domain, additional registers, referred to as `en_clap_one` and `en_clap_two`, facilitate delay and propagation management for `data_en`.

6. **Constraints and Logic Design**:
   - Implement logic in which all associated registers are cleared or set to zero when their respective reset signals are active.
   - After the reset condition ceases (meaning that `arstn` for the `clk_a` domain or `brstn` for the `clk_b` domain return to high), the data movements and state transitions should adhere strictly to the described synchronization mechanism.

7. **Output Characteristics**:
   - The multi-bit output signal, `dataout`, should reflect the synchronized data, contingent upon the activity of the `en_clap_two` register within the `clk_b` domain. If the `en_clap_two` signal is not active, `dataout` should maintain its last valid state.

Your task is to encapsulate this detailed functional description, comprising the interaction of signals, the synchronization process, and the handling of reset conditions, into a coherent and comprehensive Verilog code for the `synchronizer` module. The goal is to ensure that the module achieves its designed purpose as a robust multi-bit MUX-based synchronizer, efficiently facilitating data transfer and synchronization between the distinct clock domains while adhering to the given constraints.
