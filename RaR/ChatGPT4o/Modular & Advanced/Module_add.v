Imagine you are an experienced Digital Design Engineer working at a prominent hardware design company. Your current assignment is to design a vital Verilog module that will significantly impact the success of an upcoming next-generation product. The successful development of this module is crucial for upholding your companyâ€™s esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

The task at hand requires you to work with an existing module named `add16`, which is specifically designed to perform addition of two 16-bit numbers. Your goal is to utilize this existing 16-bit adder module to create a new module capable of adding two 32-bit numbers. To achieve this, you must instantiate the `add16` module twice to effectively construct a 32-bit adder.

The approach involves the following steps:
1. The first instance of the `add16` module will handle the lower 16 bits of the 32-bit numbers being added. It will output both the 16-bit sum and a carry-out signal.
2. The second instance of the `add16` module will process the upper 16 bits of the 32-bit numbers. Importantly, this second module must utilize the carry-out from the first module as a carry-in input to ensure accurate computation of the upper bits.

It's important to note that while the 32-bit adder as a whole does not need to account for an initial carry-in (you can assume this to be zero) or produce an overarching carry-out signal, the collaboration between the two `add16` instances relies on these signals to function correctly internally. Essentially, while the `add16` adds `a + b + cin` at the 16-bit level, your objective is to achieve the addition of `a + b` at the 32-bit scale without any external carry handling.

Visualize the interconnections between these modules as you refer to an illustrative diagram provided for reference. The `add16` module has the following specific declaration to keep in mind:

```verilog
module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );
```

With this understanding, your task is to create the `top_module`, starting from the basic template provided below, and insert the necessary code to achieve the desired 32-bit addition functionality:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);

// Your design implementation goes here.

endmodule
```

Your expertise in digital design is crucial in seamlessly integrating these modules to perform as the 32-bit adder that fulfills the project's stringent requirements.
