Consider this scenario: You are working as a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, where you are entrusted with the crucial task of developing an essential Verilog module that will form part of a next-generation product. This module is fundamentally important as its performance and reliability could significantly impact the company's standing and reputation within the competitive computer hardware industry.

The specific task involves taking an existing Verilog module, referred to as `mod_a`, which has been provided to you, and creating a single instance of it within your own design. The `mod_a` module comes with three specific ports – `in1`, `in2`, and `out`. Your responsibility is to correctly instantiate this module within your top-level module so that the connections between the relevant ports of `mod_a` and your top-level module are established accurately.

To do this, you need to connect `mod_a`'s three ports to the corresponding ports of your top-level module named `top_module`. In particular, your top-level module has three exposed ports: `a`, `b`, and `out`, which are inputs and outputs that must be connected to `mod_a`'s `in1`, `in2`, and `out` respectively.

It is crucial to focus on the interfacing between the ports: how the signals are routed from your top-level module’s ports to `mod_a`'s ports. It is a detail-oriented task as you must ensure seamless connectivity without altering or needing to inspect the internal logic of `mod_a`. Your challenge is to implement this seamlessly as it is critical for the broader project development.

Given this, how would you structure your top-level module code in Verilog to achieve these connections appropriately, ensuring that the instantiation complies with the specifications provided and maintains signal integrity throughout the module interaction?
