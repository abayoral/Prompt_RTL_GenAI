Imagine you are a senior FPGA Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, entrusted with an important task of developing a crucial Verilog module for a forthcoming high-tech product. The performance and reliability of this module are of paramount importance, as it holds significant weight in upholding your company's esteemed position within the competitive hardware industry.

You've been provided with a module referred to as `mod_a`. This module comprises six total ports, featuring two output ports and four input ports, though their specific sequence within the module is not initially clear.

Your specific task involves connecting these six ports by their explicit names to the matching ports of a top-level module within your Verilog design. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown of how the ports from `mod_a` should be connected to those in the `top_module`.

In `mod_a`, you have:
- Two output ports, named `out1` and `out2`
- Four input ports, defined as `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, and `in4`

In your `top_module`, they correspond to:
- Outputs: `out1`, `out2`
- Inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`

Below, you are presented with the existing declaration of `mod_a`:

```verilog
module mod_a ( output out1, output out2, input in1, input in2, input in3, input in4);
```

Additionally, the following skeleton structure of your `top_module` is available:

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c,
    input d,
    output out1,
    output out2
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Your objective is to strategically link these outputs and inputs appropriately between these two modules. This involves inserting the necessary Verilog code within the designated space in the `top_module` to ensure the ports align correctly with their respective counterparts, thereby enabling seamless functionality within the overarching design. The requirement is to establish these connections accurately to ensure the overall integrity and performance of the system.
