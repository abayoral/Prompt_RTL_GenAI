Imagine you are functioning in the role of an expert in Verilog design tasked with developing a module that effectively produces a periodic clock signal within a hardware description framework. The central functionality of this task involves creating a signal that switches between high and low states at precise, regular intervals. The duration between these state changes is controlled by a specific parameter known as PERIOD, which you must define within your code.

Here are the precise requirements and specifications for the module you've been asked to develop:

1. **Module Identifier**: Assign your design the specific identifier `clkgenerator`. This is the name under which the module will be recognized and utilized within larger systems or projects.

2. **Main Parameter**: The crucial parameter in this design is `PERIOD`. It serves as the defining factor for the full duration of the clock signal's cycle, typically given a default setting of 10. This parameter controls the timing characteristics and ensures that the clock signal aligns with the desired operational frequency.

3. **Output Specification**: Your module should include a single primary output known as `clk`. This output is essential as it will serve as the conduit through which the generated clock signal is relayed. The signal on this port should reflect the periodic nature dictated by the PARAMETER setting.

4. **Design Details and Considerations**: It is imperative that in your design, you implement the use of an initial block. This block should be used to define the starting state of the clock signal, setting it to 0. The toggling (or switching) mechanism of the clock output, which is pivotal to forming a square wave (a wave with equal time spent in the high state as in the low state), should occur at intervals corresponding to half of the PERIOD parameter. This timing ensures that the clock behaves with consistency as expected in synchronous designs.

Your assignment is to deliver a fully realized Verilog code that satisfies these detailed conditions and specifications, ensuring that the `clkgenerator` module operates correctly within its intended role of generating a reliable clock signal.
