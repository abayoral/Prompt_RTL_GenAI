The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that consist of three bytes each. However, when dealing with a continuous stream of bytes, it is not immediately clear where individual messages begin and end. The only clue provided is that the first byte of each three-byte message always has its fourth bit (bit[3]) set to 1. The other two bytes in the message may have bit[3] set to either 1 or 0, depending on the data they contain.

We need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that identifies message boundaries within an incoming byte stream based on the described protocol rules. Specifically, the FSM should keep track of byte positions and detect the start of messages by looking for bytes where bit[3] is set to 1. Upon detecting such a byte, the FSM should assume it is the first byte of a new message and continue to count the subsequent bytes to track the complete message. Once the FSM has successfully received all three bytes of a message, it should signal the completion or reception of the message.

The required FSM should meet the following criteria:
1. Discard incoming bytes until a byte with bit[3] equal to 1 is detected, treating this byte as the beginning of a new message.
2. Continue tracking the next two bytes as parts of the current message.
3. Signal "done" immediately after the third byte of each message is received, indicating that a complete message has been processed.

Note that the FSM will have only one input signal, `in[3]`, which represents the fourth bit of the incoming byte stream. Despite this single input, the FSM needs to process the bytes correctly to identify and signal message boundaries.

Considering the above requirements, the FSM would need around four states to function effectively. Three states are likely insufficient because one state is needed to assert the "done" signal, and this signal should be asserted for only one cycle after each complete message is received.

Below is a basic module outline for the FSM, which includes placeholders for your code, such as state transition logic, state flip-flops, and output logic:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output done); 

    // Insert your code below

    // State transition logic (combinational)

    // State flip-flops (sequential)
 
    // Output logic

endmodule
```
