Certainly! Here is a rephrased and expanded version of the original question to provide more clarity and detail:

---

The provided Verilog code includes logic that incorrectly creates a latch, causing unintended behavior. Your task is to identify and correct the bugs within the code so that it correctly performs the following actions:

1. **Shut off the computer only if the CPU is truly overheated.**
2. **Stop driving if either of the following conditions is met:**
   - You have arrived at your destination.
   - The gas tank is empty and thus needs refueling.

The given code snippet is as follows:

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving  ); //

    // Fix the bug in the following code
    
    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
           shut_off_computer = 1;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived)
           keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
    end

endmodule
```

**Detailed Descriptions of Intended Functionalities:**

1. **Shutting Off the Computer:**
   - The computer should only be shut off (`shut_off_computer` should be set to `1`) when the `cpu_overheated` input signal is active.
   
2. **Determining Whether to Keep Driving:**
   - You should continue driving (`keep_driving` should be set to `1`) unless you have arrived at your destination (`arrived` is active) or the gas tank is empty (`gas_tank_empty` is active). If either of these conditions is met, you should stop driving (`keep_driving` should be set to `0`).

Review the given code for any logical errors, latches or incomplete conditions that may prevent the code from functioning as intended. Make the necessary corrections to ensure the code behaves correctly under all specified conditions.
