Imagine you are designing a digital circuit tasked with interpreting scancodes from a PS/2 keyboard within a gaming application. Your objective is to determine if an arrow key has been pressed based on the last two bytes of scancodes received. Specifically, you will need to map these scancodes to the corresponding arrow key presses using a case statement or an if-elseif structure. Here's the mapping you need to implement:

- If the scancode is `16'he06b`, this corresponds to the left arrow key being pressed.
- If the scancode is `16'he072`, this corresponds to the down arrow key being pressed.
- If the scancode is `16'he074`, this corresponds to the right arrow key being pressed.
- If the scancode is `16'he075`, this corresponds to the up arrow key being pressed.
- For any other scancode values, it should indicate that none of the arrow keys are pressed.

You are to design this circuit such that it takes a single 16-bit input scancode and produces four different outputs (one for each arrow key). The outputs should be asserted (set to `1`) when the corresponding arrow key is pressed.

Additionally, it is essential to handle all possible conditions to avoid creating latches in your circuit design. This means that all four outputs need to be assigned a value for every possible scancode. A common solution for this is to initialize all outputs to zero before entering the case statement or if-elseif structure. This approach ensures that outputs are only set to `1` if the specific scancode matching an arrow key is received.

Here's a sample outline to guide your implementation:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up);

    always @(*) begin
        // Initialize all outputs to 0.
        up = 1'b0; 
        down = 1'b0; 
        left = 1'b0; 
        right = 1'b0;

        // Determine which arrow key, if any, is pressed based on scancode.
        case (scancode)
            // Your case statement here.
            ...
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

Ensure that within the `case` statement or appropriate conditional blocks, outputs are explicitly assigned values under all circumstances. This makes the circuit more efficient and eliminates the risk of unintentional latches.
