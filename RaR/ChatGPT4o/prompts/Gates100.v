Certainly! Here is an expanded and clarified version of your question:

---

Design and implement a combinational circuit module that accepts 100 input signals, labeled as `in[99:0]`. This module is required to produce three distinct output signals based on the logical operations performed on the 100 inputs.

The specifications for the outputs are as follows:

1. **out_and**: This output should be the result of a 100-input AND gate, meaning it should output a logical high if and only if all 100 input signals are logical high. Any logical low input will result in this output being logical low.

2. **out_or**: This output should be the result of a 100-input OR gate. It should output a logical high if at least one of the 100 input signals is logical high. If all the input signals are logical low, this output should be logical low.

3. **out_xor**: This output should be the result of a 100-input XOR gate. It should output a logical high if there is an odd number of logical high inputs among the 100 input signals. If there is an even number of logical high inputs, the output should be logical low.

You are encouraged to utilize reduction operators to compute these outputs, as they provide a convenient way to perform aggregate operations over multi-bit vectors in hardware description languages.

The module declaration and interface are provided below:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor 
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

In the module `top_module`, you need to implement the logic to generate the three required output signals based on the 100 input signals. Ensure that the logic for each output is correctly defined to meet the functionality described.

This should provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the task.
