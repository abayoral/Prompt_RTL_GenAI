The task is to design a circuit, known as a "population count" circuit, which counts the number of '1's present in a given input vector. Specifically, you are required to build this circuit for an input vector that is 255 bits wide. The final count of '1's should be provided as an 8-bit output.

To clarify:

1. **Input Vector**: The input vector, named `in`, consists of 255 bits (numbered from bit 0 to bit 254).
2. **Output Count**: The output, named `out`, is an 8-bit wide signal that will contain the total count of '1's in the input vector.
3. **Implementation Suggestion**: As indicated by the hint, a potential approach to achieve this could involve the use of a `for` loop. This may imply iterating through each bit of the input vector, checking if it is a '1', and accumulating the count.

With these details in mind, your task is to implement this circuit within a Verilog module. The top-level module has been partially defined for you as shown below. You need to insert the necessary code to complete this functionality:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [254:0] in,
    output [7:0] out
    );
    // Insert your code here
endmodule
```

Ensure that your implementation correctly counts the number of '1's in the 255-bit input vector and assigns this count to the 8-bit output. Consider the size constraints and proper handling of the input bits within the provided vector.
