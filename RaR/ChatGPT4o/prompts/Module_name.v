Certainly! Here is the expanded version of the question with more details:

You are provided with a Verilog module named `mod_a` that has a total of six ports: two output ports and four input ports. The names of these ports are not provided in any specific order. Your task is to correctly connect each of these ports to the corresponding ports of another module called `top_module`. The connections between the ports of `mod_a` and `top_module` are specified as follows:

- The output port named `out1` in `mod_a` should connect to the output port `out1` in `top_module`.
- The output port named `out2` in `mod_a` should connect to the output port `out2` in `top_module`.
- The input port named `in1` in `mod_a` should connect to the input port `a` in `top_module`.
- The input port named `in2` in `mod_a` should connect to the input port `b` in `top_module`.
- The input port named `in3` in `mod_a` should connect to the input port `c` in `top_module`.
- The input port named `in4` in `mod_a` should connect to the input port `d` in `top_module`.

For reference, you are provided with the definition of the `mod_a` module, which is as follows:
```verilog
module mod_a (
    output out1, 
    output out2, 
    input in1, 
    input in2, 
    input in3, 
    input in4
);
```

Additionally, here is the definition of the `top_module`:
```verilog
module top_module (
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c, 
    input d, 
    output out1, 
    output out2
);
    // Insert your code here
endmodule
```

Place your code at the specified "Insert your code here" location to correctly instantiate the `mod_a` module within the `top_module` and establish the required port connections.
