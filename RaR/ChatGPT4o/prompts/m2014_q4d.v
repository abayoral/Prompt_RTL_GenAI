Could you please provide a detailed implementation for a D flip-flop using Verilog? The module should be named `top_module` and should have three ports: `clk` for the clock signal, `in` for the data input, and `out` for the data output. The synthesized D flip-flop should capture the value of the `in` signal on the rising edge of the `clk` signal and then hold this value stable at the `out` port until the next rising edge of `clk`. Ensure that your design considers typical digital design practices for flip-flops within an FPGA or similar digital circuit design context. 

Here is the module header provided for your reference:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input in, 
    output out);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```
