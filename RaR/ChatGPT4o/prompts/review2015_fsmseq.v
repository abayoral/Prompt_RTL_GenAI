Certainly! Let's reframe and elaborate on the original question to make it clearer:

---

You are tasked with designing a finite-state machine (FSM) that continuously scans an input bit stream to detect a specific sequence of bits, specifically '1101'. When your FSM successfully identifies this sequence in the stream of bits, it should set an output signal, `start_shifting`, to a high state (1) and maintain this state indefinitely, until a reset signal is received.

Once the FSM reaches and identifies the sequence '1101', it will stay in its final state. This behavior models a transition to other parts of a larger FSM, which may be implemented in subsequent steps or exercises. The intent is to simulate the FSM getting "stuck" in this final state, representing a simplified scenario where further state transitions would occur in a more complex design.

To clarify the requirements for your FSM:

1. **Inputs:**
   - `clk`: Clock signal to synchronize the FSM transitions.
   - `reset`: Synchronous reset signal that initializes or resets the FSM when asserted.
   - `data`: Input bit stream that the FSM scans for the sequence '1101'.

2. **Output:**
   - `start_shifting`: Signal that should be set to 1 when the sequence '1101' is detected and should remain high until a reset occurs.

Develop your finite-state machine within the provided Verilog module template, named `top_module`. The `clk`, `reset`, and `data` signals dictate state transitions, while `start_shifting` is the output that signals the detection of the sequence. Insert your FSM code within the given module skeleton:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,      // Synchronous reset
    input data,
    output start_shifting);

    // Insert your FSM code here

endmodule
```

Design this FSM such that it begins scanning from the reset state, transitions through the necessary states upon receiving their corresponding bit inputs, and finally reaches the desired output state upon detecting the sequence '1101'. Make sure the FSM can handle synchronous resets and maintain the output state correctly after the sequence has been found.

This FSM will serve as the basis for further expansions and integrations in upcoming exercises.
