// You are tasked with implementing a module in Verilog to find the minimum value among four unsigned 8-bit numbers (a, b, c, d). 
// These numbers can be compared using the standard comparison operators, such as (a < b). 
// You're required to utilize the conditional (ternary) operator to construct two-way min circuits and then combine multiple of these circuits to create an overall 4-way min circuit. 
// This means you'll likely need to define intermediary steps to store partial results using wire vectors. 
// For instance, you may start by comparing two numbers at a time, store the smallest into an intermediary wire, and subsequently compare the results of these intermediaries. 
// Consider the following module template to start:

module top_module (
    input [7:0] a, b, c, d,
    output [7:0] min
);

    // Define variables to hold intermediate results
    // Example: wire [7:0] intermediate_result1, intermediate_result2;

    // Create two-way comparison circuits using the conditional operator
    // Example: assign intermediate_result1 = (a < b) ? a : b;

    // Combine the intermediate comparisons to create a 4-way min circuit
    // Example: assign min = (intermediate_result1 < intermediate_result2) ? intermediate_result1 : intermediate_result2;
