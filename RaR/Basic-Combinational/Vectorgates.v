Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design firm, tasked with a significant challenge: developing a critical Verilog module for an upcoming, state-of-the-art product. The successful implementation of this module is crucial to sustaining your company's esteemed position within the fiercely competitive computer hardware industry. 

Your task involves creating a circuit with the following specific requirements: 

1. You will be working with two 3-bit input vectors, denoted as 'a' and 'b.' 
   
2. Your goal is to produce several outputs from these inputs:
   - The first output, `out_or_bitwise`, should be the result of performing a bitwise OR operation on these two vectors. This operation combines the bits of 'a' and 'b,' yielding another 3-bit vector where each bit is the OR result of the corresponding bits in 'a' and 'b.'
   
   - The second output, `out_or_logical`, should reflect the logical OR of the inputs. Unlike the bitwise OR, which operates on individual bits, the logical OR evaluates whether at least one of the entire vectors ('a' or 'b') can be deemed as logically 'true' (non-zero) and produces a single-bit output.

   - The final output, `out_not`, is a 6-bit vector where:
     - The upper three bits (positions [5:3]) must contain the inverse (NOT operation) of the input vector 'b.'
     - The lower three bits (positions [2:0]) must represent the inverse (NOT operation) of the input vector 'a.' 

A note of caution is that in Verilog, while you cannot assign values to a wire more than once, you can make use of part select operations on the left-hand side of an `assign` statement. This means that you can assign different parts of a vector separately. As a design tip, you're not required to assign values to the whole vector in a single line, allowing for more modular and readable code.

Therefore, you're inviting to craft this `top_module` by accurately coding these Verilog operations to fulfill the outlined specifications, ensuring that the outputs conform to the described logic. The precise functioning of these operations is instrumental for the module to perform as required, contributing to the product's success and, consequently, your company's standing in the market. 

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [2:0] a,
    input [2:0] b,
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
    output out_or_logical,
    output [5:0] out_not
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule
