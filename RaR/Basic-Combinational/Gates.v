Imagine you are assuming the role of a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading company specializing in hardware design. You have been enlisted to develop a crucial Verilog module for the next generation of the company's product line, which is essential for maintaining the company's reputation within the competitive computer hardware industry. Your task involves constructing a combinational digital circuit that will take in two boolean inputs, denoted as `a` and `b`. From these inputs, the circuit should produce a total of seven outputs, each determined by specific logic gates. These outputs are as follows:

1. **out_and**: This output is the result of the logical AND operation between the inputs `a` and `b`.

2. **out_or**: This output is obtained by applying the logical OR operation to the inputs `a` and `b`.

3. **out_xor**: This output results from the logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation on inputs `a` and `b`.

4. **out_nand**: This output is derived from the logical NAND operation, which is the negation of the AND operation applied to `a` and `b`.

5. **out_nor**: This output comes from the logical NOR operation, which is the negation of the OR operation for the inputs `a` and `b`.

6. **out_xnor**: This output results from the logical XNOR (exclusive NOR) operation, which is the negation of the XOR operation for inputs `a` and `b`.

7. **out_anotb**: This output is defined by the AND operation between input `a` and the negation of input `b`, essentially performing an AND operation with `a` and the logical NOT of `b`.

You are tasked to implement these operations within the provided Verilog module template. The module `top_module` is equipped with the inputs `a` and `b` and is expected to generate the specified outputs according to the logic described. Your design should be robust, efficient, and meet all specification requirements to ensure the module's reliability and performance in the final product. The overall success of this module is key to upholding the company's status as an industry leader. 

Here is the template you will work with:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, b,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor,
    output out_nand,
    output out_nor,
    output out_xnor,
    output out_anotb
);
	// Insert your code here
endmodule
```

Consider the operational constraints and aims of this development to secure the quality and dependability of the final design.
