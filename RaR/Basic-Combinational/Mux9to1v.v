As a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you are entrusted with the critical task of developing a vital Verilog module for an innovative and next-generation product. The module you are tasked to build is a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer, which is crucial to the product's performance and plays a key role in reinforcing the company's esteemed reputation within the competitive computer hardware industry.

This multiplexer module should have an input selection line (`sel`) of 4 bits that can select among nine possible 16-bit inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and `i`. Here, `sel=0` corresponds to selecting input `a`, `sel=1` corresponds to selecting input `b`, and this pattern continues similarly for the rest until `sel=8`, which corresponds to input `i`.

It is important to note that for any `sel` values ranging from 9 to 15, which are unused in this context, the multiplexer must produce an output where all 16 bits are set to '1'. This design consideration helps manage unexpected selection inputs by defaulting them to a known state.

To implement this logic, given the range of potential selections, using a case statement is beneficial because it can comprehensively and clearly handle all the required decision branches based on the `sel` input.

Developing this module not only requires technical accuracy but also demands an attention to innovative approaches and reliability in your design methodology. This module is pivotal in ensuring top-notch performance and maintaining the company's leadership status in a rapidly evolving tech industry.

Below is the template provided for this Verilog module, where your implementation should fit within the "Insert your code here" section:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [15:0] a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,
    input [3:0] sel,
    output [15:0] out );

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
``` 

Carefully consider the constraints and requirements described above as you proceed to develop and implement this Verilog multiplexer module.
