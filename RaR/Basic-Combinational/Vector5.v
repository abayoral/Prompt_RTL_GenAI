As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company, you are entrusted with the critical task of developing a Verilog module that will be integral to a next-generation product currently in development. The focus of this task is to create a module that performs specific operations on input signals—crucial for upholding and further enhancing your company’s esteemed reputation in the competitive computer hardware industry.

The challenge involves working with five binary (1-bit) input signals, denoted as 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Your objective is to conduct pairwise comparisons between these input signals and compute the results of these comparisons in the form of an output vector. The resulting output should be a 25-bit vector where each bit represents the result of a comparison between a pair of the input signals.

For each pairwise comparison:

- The output bit should be set to '1' if the two bits being compared are equal, meaning both are either '0' or both are '1'. 
- Conversely, if the two bits differ, the output bit should be '0'.

To explain further, including the pairs themselves:

- With five inputs, there are a total of 25 possible pairs if each signal is compared with itself and every other signal. 
- Therefore, the output vector will contain 25 results of these pairwise comparisons.
- The indexing should work in such a way that adjacent comparisons are made explicit through the arrangement. For instance, the last element of the vector, `out[24]`, should represent the comparison of 'a' with itself (i.e., `a == a`), which is trivially true and should always be 1.

Additionally, you are provided with a hint to consider using the logical XNOR operation for performing these comparisons, as it directly yields '1' upon equality and '0' upon discrepancy. 

Your task is to accurately implement the logical operations necessary to fill the 25-bit vector based on the relationships between each of the input pairs. The implementation should efficiently and correctly use Verilog syntax and logic to achieve the expected functionality. This involves detailing which specific comparisons each bit of the 25-bit vector corresponds to and ensuring that the module meets the given specification. 

In summary, the task requires a comprehensive understanding of logical operations and proficiency in Verilog to create a module capable of producing the correct output vector from specified input signals, significantly impacting the company's reputation and product success.
