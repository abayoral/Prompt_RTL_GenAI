Imagine you are in the role of a senior Digital Design Engineer at a renowned hardware design company. Your current project is of significant importance as it involves the development of a critical Verilog module that forms part of a next-generation product. This module's performance and reliability are crucial, as they directly impact your company's prestige and influence within the competitive computer hardware market.

Your task involves designing a simple yet fundamental digital logic component: a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer. The function of a multiplexer is to choose between two input signals and output one of them based on a control signal. Specifically, you need to implement a digital logic block that has two single-bit inputs, labeled 'a' and 'b', and an additional single-bit input named 'sel', which serves as the select signal. The output of this module, labeled 'out', should reflect the value of 'a' when the select input 'sel' is at a logical low level (0), and should show the value of 'b' when 'sel' is at a logical high level (1).

The suggestion has been made to use the ternary operator, formatted as (condition ? iftrue : iffalse), for implementing this functionality due to its readability and compatibility with Verilog syntax. This operator provides a concise method for conditionally selecting a value based on a boolean expression. 

Below is the framework of your Verilog module, named `top_module`, where you are required to insert your Verilog code to achieve the described functionality:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, b, sel,
    output out ); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

To clarify, your goal is to effectively fill in the logic within this module to ensure it serves its purpose as a multiplexer, determining and passing through the correct input signal based on the value of `sel`, thereby upholding the high standards of dependability and performance expected of your company's products.
