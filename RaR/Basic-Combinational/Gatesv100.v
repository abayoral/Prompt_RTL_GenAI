As a senior Digital Design Engineer at a preeminent hardware development company, you have been entrusted with the significant responsibility of crafting a crucial Verilog module intended for an innovative, next-generation hardware product. The performance and precision of this module are essential to uphold the high standards and reputation that your computer hardware company has established within the industry. Your primary challenge involves analyzing a 100-bit input vector labeled 'in[99:0]' and generating three distinct output vectors based on specific bit relationships:

1. **Output Vector 'out_both'**: This vector (out_both[98:0]) is designed to evaluate a relationship where each bit signifies whether both the current bit and the adjacent bit to the left in the input vector are set to '1'. For instance, 'out_both[98]' should reflect the condition where both 'in[98]' and its left neighbor 'in[99]' are '1'. Note that for 'in[99]', which lacks a left neighbor, the vector doesn't need any output, thus excluding 'out_both[99]'.

2. **Output Vector 'out_any'**: This vector (out_any[99:1]) should determine whether any of the bits in the input vector or their neighboring bits to the right are '1'. For example, 'out_any[2]' should indicate if either 'in[2]' or its right neighbor 'in[1]' is '1'. Since 'in[0]' lacks a right neighbor, the response is inherently predetermined, so 'out_any[0]' is not required.

3. **Output Vector 'out_different'**: This vector (out_different[99:0]) examines the divergence between each bit in the input vector and its left neighbor. In this context, treat the vector as cyclic, meaning each end-wraps-around. Thus, for the wrap-around scenario, 'in[99]' is considered to have 'in[0]' as its left neighbor. For example, 'out_different[98]' should indicate whether 'in[98]' and 'in[99]' differ from one another, while 'out_different[99]' checks if 'in[99]' is distinct from 'in[0]'.

Your task is to implement this Verilog module within a succinct and efficient design framework, employing no more than three 'assign' statements as suggested in the hint provided, to achieve the outlined functionalities. This requirement underscores the need for a meticulous approach to vector manipulation and logic construction, reinforcing the critical nature of this task in the context of advanced digital design practices.
