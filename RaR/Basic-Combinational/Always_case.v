You currently hold the position of a senior Digital Design Engineer at a top-tier hardware design firm, with the specific role of developing a critical Verilog module for an upcoming groundbreaking product. The reliability and performance of this module are crucial as they significantly impact the standing of your computer hardware company in a highly competitive industry sector. Your assignment involves using a case statement, which is considered advantageous over if statements when handling a substantial number of conditions, to construct a 6-to-1 multiplexer. The task is to design this multiplexer so that, depending on the 3-bit selector input 'sel', it chooses one of six 4-bit wide data inputs (data0, data1, data2, data3, data4, data5) to be the output. If 'sel' is a value that falls within the range 0 to 5, the output should reflect the corresponding data input. However, if 'sel' is outside this specified range, the output should default to 0. It is important during this design process to avoid inadvertently creating latches, which can occur if all conditions in the case statement are not properly accounted for or specified. The code should abide by the Verilog syntax version 2001, within a module definition that begins with identifying inputs and outputs clearly, alongside an always block that signifies a combinational logic circuit. Crafting the 'case' statement accurately within this block is essential to ensure the desired functionality of the multiplexer.
