As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer employed at a prestigious hardware design company, you have been entrusted with a critical task that involves designing and developing an essential Verilog module for a cutting-edge product. The accomplishment of this module is crucial not only for the technical success of the product but also for safeguarding and enhancing the esteemed reputation of your computer hardware company within the competitive technology industry.

Your specific assignment is to design a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog. This multiplexer needs to channel one selected input from a collection of 256 available inputs. All of these inputs are conveniently bundled into a single 256-bit input vector, allowing for efficient handling and manipulation within the design.

The functionality of this multiplexer is determined by an 8-bit selection input, `sel`, which operates in the following manner: when `sel` is equal to 0, the multiplexer will output the input bit located at `in[0]`; if `sel` equals 1, it will choose the bit at `in[1]`; if `sel` equals 2, it will select the bit at `in[2]`, and so forth, up to when `sel` equals 255, at which point the bit at `in[255]` should be selected.

You are encouraged to consider that, due to the expansive number of options available, utilizing a `case` statement in this scenario might not be the most effective approach. It's important to note that Verilog allows vector indices to be variable, provided that the compiler can ascertain that the number of bits being accessed remains constant throughout the operation. Specifically, when selecting a single bit from a vector using a variable index, the code should function correctly as expected.

You are required to implement this functionality in the `top_module`, which has been partially provided. The module declaration includes:
- An input vector `in` comprising 256 bits, representing the potential multiplexer inputs.
- An 8-bit input `sel` for selecting which of the 256 inputs should be routed to the output.
- An output `out` that signifies the selected bit.

Your implementation must be encapsulated within this module, demonstrating your expertise in creating an efficient and reliable solution in Verilog for this pivotal component of your company's next-generation hardware product.
