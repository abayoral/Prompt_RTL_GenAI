You are a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design organization, and you've been entrusted with the development of a crucial Verilog module that will be integral to a next-generation product release. The performance and reliability of this module are essential for upholding the esteemed reputation of your company within the competitive computer hardware industry. Your task involves designing a combinational circuit characterized by four binary inputs, labeled as in[3:0]. 

The module is expected to produce three distinct outputs, each corresponding to a different logical operation performed on the input data. Specifically, the requirements for the outputs are as follows:

1. `out_and`: This output should reflect the result of a 4-input AND gate, meaning it should output a logic high value only if all four inputs are high. 

2. `out_or`: This output must be the result of a 4-input OR gate, giving a high logic state if at least one of the inputs is high.

3. `out_xor`: This output should be derived from a 4-input XOR gate, displaying a high logic value if an odd number of inputs are high.

Describe the implementation of these gates in the context of your Verilog module. The name of the module should be specified as `top_module`, with the necessary structural and functional Verilog code implemented within. Note that this undertaking is not simply an exercise in designing logic gates, but also a critical component in a larger product architecture that the company is eagerly anticipating. Such a design will not only reflect your technical prowess but also influence the technological standing of your company in the market.
