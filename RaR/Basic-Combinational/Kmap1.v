As a seasoned Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been entrusted with the crucial task of developing an essential Verilog module for an advanced, next-generation product. The performance and effectiveness of this module are vital for ensuring that our company retains its esteemed reputation within the competitive computer hardware industry. This module's reliability and efficiency are paramount.

Your specific task is to implement a digital circuit as detailed by the Karnaugh map provided below. The map has been constructed based on certain binary-value inputs, which are key to understanding the intended logic of the circuit.

Here's the Karnaugh map, organized by input variables 'a', 'b', and 'c':

- For the variable 'a', which can be either a'(0) or a(1),
- And for the combination of variables 'b' and 'c', which represent the values b'c'(00), b'c (01), bc(11), and bc'(10).

The Karnaugh map is structured as follows:

|   Condition  | a'(0) | a(1) |
|:------------:|:-----:|:----:|
| b'c'(00)     |   1   |  1   |
| b'c (01)     |   1   |  1   |
| bc (11)      |   1   |  1   |
| bc'(10)      |   1   |  1   |

Your task includes simplifying the Karnaugh map to derive the minimal logic expressions for both product-of-sums (POS) and sum-of-products (SOP) forms. While there is no mechanism to verify if the simplification you obtain is the absolute optimal solution, it is possible to check if your logical expression is functionally equivalent to the map. Additionally, you should be able to effectively translate the simplified expression into a Verilog-based circuit.

You are to accomplish this by writing a Verilog module named 'top_module', which takes three input signals (a, b, c) and produces an output signal labeled 'out'. The structure of your Verilog code should reflect the simplification achieved through the Karnaugh map analysis.

Here is the initial structure of the Verilog module where you will insert your logic:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output out
);

// Insert your logic here

endmodule
``` 

Your expertise in digital design and understanding of Verilog will be critical in successfully implementing this task and contributing to the future readiness of our company's groundbreaking product.
