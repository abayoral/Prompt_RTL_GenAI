You're employed in a high-ranking position as a Senior Digital Design Engineer at a prestigious and influential hardware design company. The company is recognized as a frontrunner in developing cutting-edge technology, and your responsibilities involve navigating complex design challenges. Currently, you're assigned to spearhead the development of a vital Verilog module that will play a crucial role in one of the company's flagship, next-generation products. The outcome and performance of this particular module are deemed critical because they directly influence the company's standing and credibility within the competitive computer hardware industry.

The task at hand is to create a module using Verilog, a widely adopted hardware description language used for model design and verification of digital circuits. Your specific challenge is to implement an XNOR gate within this module. An XNOR gate, or exclusive-NOR gate, is a digital logic gate that outputs true or false based on its inputs being equal. Despite its relative simplicity, implementing this correctly is essential to ensure the overall design's success.

As per the guidelines, note that while the bitwise-XOR operation in Verilog is represented using the '^' symbol, there isn't a direct logical-XOR operator available in the language. Thus, although the XNOR function is fundamentally a derivation from XOR, the implementation might require you to creatively use available operators or construct additional logical expressions to achieve the desired result.

In summary, craft a precise and efficient Verilog code within the 'top_module', where the function of the module is to take two inputs, 'a' and 'b', and compute the XNOR logic, providing the expected output signal 'out'. It is essential to ensure that the code you write is robust, reliable, and adheres to industry standards to uphold your company's esteemed reputation. 

Here is your starting code framework, where you will incorporate the Verilog expressions necessary to achieve this functionality:

```
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );

// Insert your code here

endmodule
```
