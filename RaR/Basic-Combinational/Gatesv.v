As a senior Digital Design Engineer working in a premier hardware design company, you have been entrusted with a highly significant task that could influence the company's standing in the competitive landscape of computer hardware. The task involves developing a crucial Verilog module, which forms a core component of a next-generation product currently under development. The effectiveness and precision of this module are imperative, as it directly impacts the reliability and reputation of the company's offerings.

The specific assignment requires you to analyze relationships between neighboring bits in a given four-bit input vector, represented as `in[3:0]`. Your goal is to calculate three separate output vectors based on defined interactions between these bits:

1. **Output Vector `out_both`:** This output concerns itself with identifying whether both a specific bit in the input vector and its immediate left-hand neighbor (higher index) are '1'. Each element of `out_both` corresponds to this condition. For instance, `out_both[2]` should determine if both `in[2]` and `in[3]` are '1'. Due to the absence of a left neighbor for `in[3]`, `out_both[3]` is excluded from this analysis.

2. **Output Vector `out_any`:** This vector checks for the presence of '1' in either a specific bit or its immediate right-hand neighbor. As such, `out_any[2]` should reflect whether either `in[2]` or `in[1]` is set to '1'. Given that `in[0]` lacks a right neighbor, `out_any[0]` does not need to be included.

3. **Output Vector `out_different`:** This output detects discrepancies between a specific bit and its left-hand neighbor. For instance, `out_different[2]` should show whether `in[2]` differs from `in[3]`. Additionally, the vector is considered as wrapping around, which means `in[3]` is compared against `in[0]` for this condition.

To implement these outputs, consider utilizing basic two-input logic operations—AND, OR, and XOR—within three concise `assign` statements in the Verilog code. The accuracy and efficiency of your logic will be a testament to your expertise and will ensure the success of the product's feature.
