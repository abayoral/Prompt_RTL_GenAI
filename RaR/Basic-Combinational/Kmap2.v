As the senior Digital Design Engineer at a prominent hardware design company, you have been charged with the crucial task of developing a Verilog module for an innovative, next-generation product. The circuit design required for this undertaking is defined by a Karnaugh map, which you must translate into a functional and efficient Verilog code. The successful development and performance of this module is of paramount importance, as it plays a key role in upholding the esteemed reputation of your company within the competitive computer hardware industry.

The Karnaugh map that needs to be implemented is provided below, outlining the logical values associated with various combinations of input variables. This map presents a scenario involving four binary inputs described as a, b, c, and d, each representing specific conditions or states within the circuit. The accompanying Karnaugh map outlines how these inputs interact to yield the desired output.

```
|       | a'b' | a'b  | ab  | ab' |
|-------|------|------|-----|-----|
| c'd'  | 1    | 1    | 0   | 1   |
| c'd   | 1    | 0    | 0   | 1   |
| cd    | 0    | 1    | 1   | 1   |
| cd'   | 1    | 1    | 0   | 0   |
```

You are instructed to carefully analyze and simplify this Karnaugh map, aiming to achieve an optimal expression in either product-of-sums or sum-of-products form. This simplification process is crucial to developing a streamlined and efficient logic circuit. While the system cannot verify if your simplification is the absolute optimal result, it will be able to confirm the equivalence of your reduction to the intended logic. Furthermore, your ability to accurately translate the simplified expressions from the Karnaugh map into a working Verilog circuit will also be assessed.

Upon synthesizing the logical expression from your analysis, you will proceed to implement this logic into Verilog code, incorporating the four input variables (a, b, c, d) and directing the output to 'out'. Your task is to complete the module definition with the correct logic to reflect the functionality denoted by the Karnaugh map.

```verilog
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out  
); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Your expertise and attention to detail are critical in ensuring the successful development of this circuit, ultimately contributing to the achievement of your organization's strategic objectives and technological advancement.
