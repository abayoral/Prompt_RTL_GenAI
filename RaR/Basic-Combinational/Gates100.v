Imagine you are a senior Digital Design Engineer at the forefront of hardware design innovation, working for a renowned company known for its cutting-edge technology in digital circuits and computer hardware. You are currently involved in a high-stakes project, developing a next-generation product that is crucial for sustaining your company’s esteemed reputation across the industry. Critical to this endeavor is the creation of a specific Verilog module, where your expertise and precision in designing a reliable and efficient combinational circuit are paramount.

The task requires you to construct a combinational circuit interfacing with a broad input array – precisely 100 inputs specified as in[99:0]. These inputs collectively enable the circuit to process data and produce three distinct outputs, each representing a fundamental logical operation. These outputs need to be meticulously defined and include:

1. `out_and`: This output should reflect the logical AND operation performed over all 100 inputs. It essentially requires you to implement a 100-input AND gate, where the result is true if and only if every single input in the array is true.

2. `out_or`: This output should correspond to the logical OR operation across the same 100 inputs. The expectation is to engineer a 100-input OR gate, outputting true if at least one of the inputs is true.

3. `out_xor`: For this output, you need to calculate the result of applying a 100-input XOR operation. This demands a thorough implementation where the output is true if there is an odd number of true values among the inputs.

You are encouraged to utilize reduction operators, as they facilitate efficient aggregation of multiple input data lines into a single output, to achieve the desired outcomes within your module. The task expects an accurate and efficient design implementation within the provided structure of the Verilog module.

In essence, this challenge not only demands technical knowledge and experience in digital circuit design but also creativity and strategic thinking to deliver a module that meets the high standards expected by your company and contributes to its continued success in the hardware industry.
