The goal is to create a digital circuit module using Verilog that functions as a multiplexer (MUX). In this task, you are required to design a 256-to-1 multiplexer with each input being 4 bits wide. All the 256 4-bit input vectors are combined into a single large 1024-bit input vector. The selection input (`sel`) controls which 4-bit chunk of the 1024-bit input vector is chosen. Here are the detailed requirements for the module:

1. **Module Name and Ports:**
   - Name the module `top_module`.
   - The module has three ports:
     - `input [1023:0] in`: This is a 1024-bit wide input vector containing 256 separate 4-bit values.
     - `input [7:0] sel`: This is an 8-bit selector input, which determines which 4-bit output is chosen from the 256 possible inputs.
     - `output [3:0] out`: This is a 4-bit wide output that will present the selected 4-bit chunk from the input vector.

2. **Functionality:**
   - Each 4-bit chunk within the 1024-bit input vector is arranged such that `in[3:0]` corresponds to `sel=0`.
   - For `sel=1`, the output should be `in[7:4]`.
   - For `sel=2`, the output should be `in[11:8]`, and so on, up to `sel=255` where the output should be `in[1023:1020]`.

3. **Constraints and Considerations:**
   - The large number of inputs (256) makes using conventional `case` statements impractical.
   - Verilog allows variable indices for selecting parts of a vector, but the synthesizer needs to ensure that the width of the selected bits remains constant throughout the design.
   - Directly indexing with `in[ sel*4+3 : sel*4 ]` may lead to synthesis errors; therefore, alternative indexing techniques, such as "Indexed vector part select" introduced in Verilog-2001, should be considered for a more compact and reliable implementation.

4. **Implementation Requirement:**
   - You need to implement the internal logic that correctly maps the selection input `sel` to the corresponding 4-bit segment of the 1024-bit input vector `in` and drives this segment to the 4-bit output `out`.

Given these requirements, implement the circuit to handle the described functionality efficiently within the constraints provided. Your solution should ensure the synthesizer can correctly deduce the constants and successfully generate the required hardware. 

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [1023:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output [3:0] out );

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```
