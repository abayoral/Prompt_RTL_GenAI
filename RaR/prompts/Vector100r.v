Certainly! Let's clarify and expand on the original question to make sure every detail is fully understood.

---

You are provided with an input vector that is 100 bits wide, specifically labeled as `in[99:0]`. Your task is to reverse the bit ordering of this input vector and produce an output vector, also 100 bits wide, labeled as `out[99:0]`. Reversing the bit ordering means that the least significant bit (LSB) of the input vector should become the most significant bit (MSB) of the output vector, the second least significant bit of the input should become the second most significant bit of the output, and so on. Essentially, `in[99]` should be mapped to `out[0]`, `in[98]` to `out[1]`, and this pattern continues until `in[0]` is mapped to `out[99]`.

You are encouraged to use a for loop to perform this bit-reversal operation. This for loop should be placed within a combinational always block, as this approach is preferred over a generate block for this specific task. This is because a generate block is typically used for instantiating modules or for conditional hardware generation, which is not necessary in this case.

Below is a basic structure of the module you need to complete:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [99:0] in,
    output [99:0] out
);
    // Insert your code here
endmodule
```

Make sure that your implementation correctly leverages a combinational always block to perform the bit-reversal. Avoid using any module instantiations, as the hint suggests that these are not required for this task.
