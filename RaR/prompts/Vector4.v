Certainly! Letâ€™s rephrase and expand the original question to provide further clarification and additional details for better understanding:

**Task Description:**
You are required to design a digital circuit module that takes an 8-bit signed number as an input and extends it to a 32-bit signed number. The procedure involves sign-extending the 8-bit number, which means maintaining the signed value during the conversion to a larger bit-width. Specifically, you need to replicate the sign bit (the most significant bit) of the 8-bit number 24 times to form the more significant part of the 32-bit output. 

The final 32-bit output should be constructed by concatenating these 24 replicated sign bits on the left side of the original 8-bit input number.

**Detailed Example:**
- If the input 8-bit number is `8'b01010101` (representing +85 in decimal), the most significant bit (bit[7]) is `0`. Hence, the sign bit to replicate is `0`. The 32-bit output should be `32'b00000000000000000000000001010101`.
  
- Conversely, if the input 8-bit number is `8'b10101010` (representing -86 in decimal using two's complement), the most significant bit (bit[7]) is `1`. Therefore, the sign bit to replicate is `1`. The 32-bit output should thus be `32'b11111111111111111111111110101010`.

**Hint for Implementation:**
A common technique in digital design for sign-extending involves replicating the sign bit of the smaller number to fill the additional bits on the left when expanding to a larger bit-width. The use of a replication operator can be handy for this purpose.

**Design Requirements:**
- Input: An 8-bit signed number `in` represented by `input [7:0] in`.
- Output: A 32-bit signed number `out` represented by `output [31:0] out`.

**Template Provided:**
The module is partially defined and requires you to complete the concatenation operation to achieve the desired sign-extension.

**Module Structure:**
```verilog
module top_module (
    input [7:0] in,
    output [31:0] out );//

    // Insert your code below
    // assign out = { replicate-sign-bit, the-input };

endmodule
```

You need to complete the `assign` statement in the module to correctly form the 32-bit output by concatenating the replicated sign bit and the original 8-bit input.

Note: Ensure the final implementation correctly handles both positive and negative values in the 8-bit input to preserve the sign in the 32-bit output.
