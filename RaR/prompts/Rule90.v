Rule 90 is a simple yet fascinating one-dimensional cellular automaton characterized by specific behavior during each time step.

The rules for Rule 90 can be described as follows:

- The system consists of a one-dimensional array of cells, where each cell can be either "on" (represented by 1) or "off" (represented by 0).
- At each time step, the next state of a cell is determined as the XOR (exclusive OR) of its two immediate neighbors.
- To elaborate, consider a cell with a left neighbor (Left), itself (Center), and a right neighbor (Right):

  - If Left, Center, and Right are all 1, the Center cell's next state is 0.
  - If Left and Center are 1 and Right is 0, the Center cell's next state is 1.
  - If Left and Right are 1 and Center is 0, the Center cell's next state is 0.
  - If Left is 1 and Center and Right are 0, the Center cell's next state is 1.
  - If Center is 1 and Left and Right are 0, the Center cell's next state is 0.
  - If Right is 1 and Left and Center are 0, the Center cell's next state is 1.
  - If all neighbors and the cell itself are 0, the Center cell's next state is 0.

This behavior is summarized in the following table:

| Left | Center | Right | Center's Next State |
|------|--------|-------|---------------------|
|  1   |   1    |   1   |         0           |
|  1   |   1    |   0   |         1           |
|  1   |   0    |   1   |         0           |
|  1   |   0    |   0   |         1           |
|  0   |   1    |   1   |         1           |
|  0   |   1    |   0   |         0           |
|  0   |   0    |   1   |         1           |
|  0   |   0    |   0   |         0           |

The name "Rule 90" comes from interpreting the "next state" column as a binary number (01011010), which equals 90 in decimal.

### Task:
Design a circuit in Verilog to simulate Rule 90 on a system of 512 cells. The system state is represented by an array `q` of size 512 bits (q[511:0]). The system should advance by one time step for each clock cycle. A `load` input signal indicates whether the system should be initialized with an array of data `data[511:0]`.

Assume that the boundaries of the system (q[-1] and q[512]) are always zero (off).

Here's a hint to help visualize the evolution of the cellular automaton:
For an initial state of `q[511:0] = 1` (only the leftmost cell is on), the first few iterations look like this:

```
        1
       10
      101
     1000
    10100
   100010
  1010101
 10000000
```

Notably, this pattern forms one side of a Sierpi≈Ñski triangle.

### Module Definition:
Below is the skeleton of the Verilog module you need to implement:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output [511:0] q
); 
    // Insert your code here to complete the implementation
endmodule
```

Fill in the code within the module to achieve the described functionality.
