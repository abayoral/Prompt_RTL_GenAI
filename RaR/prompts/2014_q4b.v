I would like to request your expertise in creating an innovative 'top_module', leveraging the Verilog hardware description language. This module must be constructed to function as a four-state shift register, with this complex structure requiring the integration of four discrete instances of the MUXDFF sub-circuit. Furthermore, it is necessary to note that the design must be compatible with the DE2 board, a prevalent Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that plays a crucial role in digital logic circuit design and testing.

Understanding the functionality of the DE2 board is essential as you will need to connect the circuit's inputs effectively. The main connection points are to the SW switches on the DE2 board, which will be tied to the 'R' inputs of your uniquely designed module. Alongside these essential links, additional inputs must be incorporated: 'clk', 'E', 'L', and 'w'. These inputs should be interfaced directly with the KEY connection points located on the DE2 board, specifically assigned to slots KEY[0], KEY[1], KEY[2], and KEY[3] as per the suggested sequence.

In addition to these assembly tasks, your designed circuit's outputs should be configured to lead directly to the LEDR[3:0] indicators on the DE2 board. These are essentially red light-emitting diodes (LED).

To assist the development of this highly intricate structure, a basic organizational layout is provided, outlining the necessary modules:

module top_module (
    input [3:0] SW,
    input [3:0] KEY,
    output [3:0] LEDR
);
endmodule

Additionally, in this blueprint, it is mandatory to situate a MUXDFF module within the Verilog file. This module might potentially adopt a structure similar to:

module MUXDFF (...);
endmodule

This MUXDFF module should be integrated directly beneath the previously detailed 'top_module'. However, take note that the specific Verilog coding for all these modules has not been supplied in this query. The scope of this inquiry only extends to the strategic assembly and connection of the modules, as well as their compatibility with the DE2 board's key features.
