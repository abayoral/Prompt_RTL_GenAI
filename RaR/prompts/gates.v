To better understand and approach the task of constructing the specified combinational circuit, let's break down and elaborate on the requirements and objectives:

The task involves creating a digital circuit module with the following characteristics:

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Inputs:**
     - `a`: A single-bit input signal.
     - `b`: A single-bit input signal.
   - **Outputs:** There are seven output signals, each representing the result of a different logical operation performed on `a` and `b`:
     - **`out_and`**: The result of the logical AND operation between `a` and `b`.
     - **`out_or`**: The result of the logical OR operation between `a` and `b`.
     - **`out_xor`**: The result of the logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation between `a` and `b`.
     - **`out_nand`**: The result of the logical NAND (NOT AND) operation between `a` and `b`.
     - **`out_nor`**: The result of the logical NOR (NOT OR) operation between `a` and `b`.
     - **`out_xnor`**: The result of the logical XNOR (exclusive NOR) operation between `a` and `b`.
     - **`out_anotb`**: The result of the logical operation where `a` is ANDed with the NOT of `b` (i.e., `a` and-not `b`).

2. **Module Definition:**
   - The module should be defined using the SystemVerilog or Verilog hardware description language (HDL). This typically includes specifying the module name, inputs, and outputs.
   - The internal logic should be implemented within the module such that each output is driven by the corresponding logical operation on inputs `a` and `b`.

3. **Structural Logic:**
   - For each defined output, the corresponding logical operation needs to be expressed using the appropriate logical operators. For example, the AND operation uses the `&` operator, OR uses the `|` operator, and so on.
   - Ensure all connections and operations are correctly implemented within the module body to reflect the specified logic functions.

Given the above requirements, the expanded task is to create a top-level module named `top_module` that takes two input signals (`a` and `b`) and computes seven distinct logical outputs based on standard logic gates. The goal is to ensure that outputs `out_and`, `out_or`, `out_xor`, `out_nand`, `out_nor`, `out_xnor`, and `out_anotb` are correctly generated by the circuit.

Here is the detailed module template with comments indicating where the logic implementation should be placed:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor,
    output out_nand,
    output out_nor,
    output out_xnor,
    output out_anotb
);
    // Insert logic for 'out_and': a AND b
    
    // Insert logic for 'out_or': a OR b
    
    // Insert logic for 'out_xor': a XOR b
    
    // Insert logic for 'out_nand': a NAND b
    
    // Insert logic for 'out_nor': a NOR b
    
    // Insert logic for 'out_xnor': a XNOR b
    
    // Insert logic for 'out_anotb': a AND (NOT b)
    
endmodule
```

Ensure the module follows the syntax and operational semantics of the Verilog hardware description language to properly define and implement the inputs, outputs, and the necessary combinational logic.
