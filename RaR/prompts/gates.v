Could you elaborate on how to methodically draft a blueprint and assemble an elaborate combinational digital circuit? This specific circuit should be constrained to only two individual inputs, labelled as 'a' and 'b', and should hold the potential to generate seven distinctive outputs. It should be stressed that each of these seven outputs must individually be regulated by a unique logic gate.

Let's elaborate on the design requirements for each of the seven outputs and their correlating logic gates:

1. 'out_and' output: This output must be supervised by an AND gate. This gate is crucial as it logically amalgamates 'a' and 'b', the two said inputs.

2. Output titled 'out_or': The OR gate should be used for this output. Its function is to generate a particular output when either 'a' or 'b' is in the active state. There might be instances when both inputs are active simultaneously, which will indeed drive the output.

3. Output labelled 'out_xor': Here, an XOR gate, standing for exclusive-OR, is necessary. This gate is designed to yield a high output if either 'a' or 'b' is active. However, it is to be noted that if both 'a' and 'b' are active simultaneously, the output won't be high.

4. 'out_nand' output: A NAND gate is essential to drive this particular output. Conceptually, a NAND gate is simply an AND gate closely followed by an inversion or NOT gate, resulting in an inverted output when compared to the output of an AND gate given the inputs 'a' and 'b'.

5. Output denoted as 'out_nor': A NOR gate should be used for this output. This is very similar to an OR gate but is immediately followed by a NOT gate. This configuration will deliver an output that is contrary to the OR gate output for inputs 'a' and 'b'.

6. Output named 'out_xnor': An XNOR gate is to be used for driving this output. An XNOR gate, also recognized as an equivalence gate, ensures a high output only when there's an even number of high inputs.

7. The final output, 'out_anotb': This output is characterized by depicting the logical operation “a and not b”.

Ideally speaking, the structure of the circuit should be a single top module where distinct logic inputs and outputs are clearly defined. You are free to initiate your design and construction process as it suits you. Lastly, it is crucial to place your code in the '// Insert your code here' section given within the finalized module.
