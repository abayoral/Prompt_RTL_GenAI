Certainly! Hereâ€™s the expanded and clarified version of the question:

---

You are provided with the state transition table for a Moore state machine that has one input signal, one output signal, and four distinct states labeled A, B, C, and D. The states are encoded using a one-hot representation as follows: A=4'b0001, B=4'b0010, C=4'b0100, D=4'b1000. This means each state is represented by a 4-bit vector where exactly one bit is set to '1', depending on the state.

Given this setup, your task is to derive the state transition and output logic equations directly from the state transition table by inspection. These equations will be a part of the combinational logic that dictates the behavior of the state machine. You are not required to include any sequential logic (such as flip-flops) in your implementation - only the part of the logic that determines the next state and the output based on the current state and the input signal.

The state transition table is presented below:

```
          Next State            Output
State   in=0   in=1
  A       A       B       0
  B       C       B       0
  C       A       D       0
  D       C       B       1
```

You should implement a Verilog module named `top_module` with the following interface:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input in,
    input [3:0] state,
    output [3:0] next_state,
    output out); //

    parameter A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3;

    // Insert your code below

    // State transition logic: Derive an equation for each state flip-flop.
    assign next_state[A] = ...;
    assign next_state[B] = ...;
    assign next_state[C] = ...;
    assign next_state[D] = ...;

    // Output logic:
    assign out = ...;

endmodule
```

### Additional Clarifications:

- **State Transition Logic**: You will need to write combinational logic equations for `next_state[A]`, `next_state[B]`, `next_state[C]`, and `next_state[D]`, which determine the next state given the current state and the input signal `in`.
- **Output Logic**: You will also write the combinational logic for `out`, which depends only on the current state.
- **Testing**: The testbench may introduce non-one-hot inputs to ensure that your logic correctly handles only one-hot encoded states.

By carefully inspecting the state transition table, derive the necessary logic equations, and implement them within the provided template to ensure correct operation of the Moore state machine.
