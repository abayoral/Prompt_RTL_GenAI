Here's a refined and expanded version of your question for clarity:

Design and implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) that selects between two input signals, `a` and `b`, based on certain conditions. Specifically, the MUX should choose the signal `b` if both of the selection signals, `sel_b1` and `sel_b2`, are true (i.e., logical high or 1). If either `sel_b1` or `sel_b2` is not true (i.e., logical low or 0), the MUX should choose the signal `a`.

You are required to implement this multiplexer twice within the same Verilog module:
1. The first implementation should utilize concurrent assignment statements (`assign`).
2. The second implementation should utilize a procedural `if` statement within an `always` block.

The module should be defined using the Verilog-2001 syntax and should include the following inputs and outputs:
- Inputs: `a`, `b`, `sel_b1`, and `sel_b2` (all of which are single-bit signals).
- Outputs: `out_assign` (the output for the concurrent assignment implementation) and `out_always` (the output for the procedural `if` implementation).

The proposed Verilog module skeleton is provided below. You are expected to complete the code by filling in the necessary logic to achieve the desired functionality.

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input sel_b1,
    input sel_b2,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always
); 

    // Insert your code here
    
endmodule
```

Please ensure that your code meets the specified requirements and properly assigns the output signals based on the given conditions.
