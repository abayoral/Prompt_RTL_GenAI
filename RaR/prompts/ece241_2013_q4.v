Certainly! Let's expand and clarify the original question to make it more detailed and easily understandable.

You are tasked with designing a control system for a large water reservoir that serves multiple users. To ensure the water level stays within acceptable limits, three sensors (S_1, S_2, S_3) are placed at vertical intervals of 5 inches. These sensors work as follows:

1. **Highest Sensor (S_3):** When the water level rises above this sensor, the input flow rate must be zero.
2. **Middle Sensor (S_2):** When the water level is between this sensor and the lowest sensor (S_1), the flow rate settings depend on whether the water level is rising or falling.
3. **Lowest Sensor (S_1):** When the water level falls below this sensor, the flow rate should be maximized. Both the Nominal flow valve and the Supplemental flow valve should be opened to allow maximum input flow.

The input flow rate needs to be adjusted based on the water level readings from the sensors and the historical trend (whether the water level is rising or falling). 

- **Water Level above the highest sensor (S_3):** Both S_1, S_2, and S_3 are activated (asserted) and the input flow rate should be zero.
- **Water Level between S_3 and S_2:** S_1 and S_2 are activated, and the nominal flow rate (FR1) should be used.
- **Water Level between S_2 and S_1:** Only S_1 is activated, and both nominal flow rates FR1 and FR2 should be activated.
- **Water Level below the lowest sensor (S_1):** No sensors are activated, and the input flow rate should be maximized (FR1, FR2, and FR3 should be activated, as well as the Supplemental flow valve through delta FR).

Additional requirements:
- If the water level is rising, the nominal flow rate associated with the current water level should be used.
- If the water level is falling, the nominal flow rate should be augmented by opening the Supplemental flow valve (indicated by delta FR).

Design a Moore finite state machine (FSM) to control the water reservoir. The FSM should:
- Have clear state transitions based on the input from the sensors (S_1, S_2, S_3).
- Control the flow rate outputs (FR1, FR2, FR3, delta FR) appropriately for each state.
- Include an active-high synchronous reset. When this reset is active, the FSM should transition to a state indicating the water level has been low for an extended period (no sensors asserted, and all four flow outputs are asserted).

The module signature is as follows:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [3:1] s,  // Sensor inputs
    output fr3,     // Flow rate control signals
    output fr2,
    output fr1,
    output dfr      // delta FR for Supplemental flow
);
    // Insert your FSM design here
endmodule
```
Provide a detailed implementation sketch for this FSM, including all necessary state transitions and output logic for each state based on the inputs.
