Here's a more detailed and expanded version of your question:

Design a Verilog module named `top_module` to implement a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10 (inclusive). The module should have the following specifications:

1. An input clock signal `clk` which will be used to drive the counting sequence.
2. A synchronous reset input signal `reset` which, when asserted, will reset the counter's output `q` to the value 1 on the next rising edge of the clock.
3. An output `q` that is 4-bits wide and represents the current count value of the counter.

The desired behavior of the counter is such that it starts counting from 1 up to 10 and then wraps around back to 1. The counter should increment its value on every rising edge of the `clk` signal. If the `reset` signal is asserted (held high) during a rising clock edge, the counter should immediately reset `q` to 1, regardless of its current value.

Define the internal logic of the module considering the above constraints. Your task is to implement the actual Verilog code to achieve this counter functionality.

Here is the module declaration as a reference:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output [3:0] q);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Make sure to include detailed logic within the module to correctly handle the counting, resetting, and wrapping behavior as described.
