Let's rephrase and elaborate on the question to increase clarity and detail:

**Design an 8x1 Memory Circuit with a Shift Register and Random Access Read Capability**

In this exercise, you will design a circuit that functions as an 8x1 memory. This memory allows for writing by shifting bits into the memory and supports random access reading, similar to typical RAM. Additionally, you will utilize this memory to implement a 3-input logic function.

1. **Shift Register Design**:
    - Begin by creating an 8-bit shift register using D-type flip-flops.
    - Label the outputs of these flip-flops as Q[0] through Q[7].
    - The input to the shift register should be labeled S. The bit provided to S will be shifted into Q[0], which is considered the most significant bit (MSB).
    - An enable input should control the shifting mechanism: when enabled, the shift register should shift in the bit at input S.

2. **Extending the Circuit with Additional Inputs**:
    - Add three more inputs to the circuit: A, B, and C.
    - Introduce an output labeled Z.
    - The circuit should behave based on the combined values of A, B, and C as a selector:
        - When ABC = 000, the output Z should be the value of Q[0].
        - When ABC = 001, the output Z should be the value of Q[1].
        - Continue this pattern up to ABC = 111, where the output Z should be the value of Q[7].

3. **Using Multiplexers for Output Selection**:
    - Implement the selection of the appropriate output Q[i] (where i ranges from 0 to 7) based on the inputs A, B, and C using multiplexers.
    - Ensure your design only includes the 8-bit shift register and the necessary multiplexers to achieve this behavior.

The final circuit, which can be referred to as a 3-input look-up table (LUT), combines the functionality of an 8-bit shift register with the ability to provide a specific output based on the 3-input selector.

Here's the skeleton of the module you need to complete in Verilog:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,      // Clock signal to synchronize the shift register
    input enable,   // Enable signal to control shifting
    input S,        // Input bit that is shifted into the register
    input A, B, C,  // 3-bit input selector for output
    output Z        // Output of the selected bit from the shift register
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

In this question, complete the above module in Verilog to fulfill the given requirements for the 8-bit shift register, selection logic, and output. Be sure to handle the clock and enable signals appropriately.
