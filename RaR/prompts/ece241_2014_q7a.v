Consider designing a modulo-12 counter with specific inputs and outputs. Here are the detailed requirements and components at your disposal:

### Inputs:
1. **Reset**: This is a synchronous, active-high reset input. When this reset signal is active (high), the counter should forcibly reset its value to 1, regardless of other inputs.
2. **Enable**: This input should be set high to allow the counter to operate. When this signal is low, the counter should not advance its count.
3. **Clk**: This is a positive edge-triggered clock input. The counter should update its value on the rising edge of the clock signal.

### Outputs:
1. **Q[3:0]**: This is a 4-bit output that represents the current value of the counter.
2. **c_enable**: A control signal that you need to generate and connect to the enable input of an internal 4-bit counter module (count4).
3. **c_load**: A control signal that you need to generate and connect to the load input of the internal count4 module. The load signal has higher priority than the enable signal.
4. **c_d[3:0]**: A 4-bit control signal that you need to generate and provide as input data (parallel load value) to the internal count4 module.

### Available Components:
1. **4-bit Binary Counter (count4)**: This is a pre-provided module that includes Enable and Synchronous Parallel-Load inputs. The load input has higher priority than the enable signal. You need to instantiate this module within your design.
2. **Logic Gates**: Use these as needed to create the required control signals.

### Goals:
- Ensure that the modulo-12 counter starts at 1 and counts up to 12.
- Reset to 1 when the Reset input is high.
- Only count when Enable is high.
- Generate and correctly connect control signals `c_enable`, `c_load`, and `c_d` to the `count4` module such that the correct operation of the counter can be verified.

### Sample Module Definition:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input enable,
    output [3:0] Q,
    output c_enable,
    output c_load,
    output [3:0] c_d
); 

    // Instantiate the provided 4-bit counter (count4). 
    // Ensure to connect the control signals correctly.

    count4 the_counter (
       .clk(clk), 
       .enable(c_enable), 
       .load(c_load), 
       .d(c_d)
       // Other necessary connections if needed
    );

endmodule
```

### Steps to Consider:
1. **Reset Logic**: Ensure your design correctly sets `c_load` and `c_d` such that the counter resets to 1 when the Reset signal is high.
2. **Counting Logic**: Properly control `c_enable` to make the counter increment on each rising clock edge when Enable is high.
3. **Wrap-Around Logic**: Make the counter wrap back from 12 to 1. Use appropriate logic gates to set `c_load` and `c_d` for the modulo-12 functionality.

You are expected to derive the necessary logic to fulfill all the requirements and ensure the correct operation of the modulo-12 counter using the `count4` module and other available components.
