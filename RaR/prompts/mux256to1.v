Your primary assignment in this case is to design a multiplexer. This multiplexer should have 1-bit output and 256 distinct inputs. All inputs should be organized into a single, all-inclusive input vector made up of 256 bits. It's critical that the multiplexer is structured so that it can select any bit from this vector at any given time. For example, if the selector (sel) is adjusted to 0, the multiplexer should have the capability to select the zeroth bit from the input vector. In the same vein, when sel equals 1, the multiplexer should be able to isolate the first bit from the input vector. This procedure should continue in a similar fashion until 255.

Do bear in mind that with a vast number of options - specifically 256 - using a case statement might not be the most viable or proficient solution. Instead, you could take advantage of the versatility of vector indices and use a variable index to pick a specific bit, given that the synthesizer could identify that the size of the bits being selected remains constant. Meaning, it is certainly feasible to choose a single bit from a vector through a variable index. 

For this task, we are providing the structure of the module named top_module which comprises three key components:

- A 256-bit input vector (in) which starts at index 255 at the highest point and descends to 0 at the bottommost end.
- An 8-bit wide input vector (sel) that starts at 7 (top end) and descends to 0 (bottom end). This will play a decisive role in choosing which bit to select from its corresponding input vector.
- An output bit (out) that displays the result after the particular bit from the input vector is chosen.

The coding assignment should be completed within this given module structure, and you have to take into account the provided guidelines. The finalized code has to achieve the operations of a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer, as explained earlier.
