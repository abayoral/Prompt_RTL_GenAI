Expand on and clarify the following task:

### Task Description
You are required to design a digital circuit module in Verilog that acts as a 256-to-1 multiplexer, with each of the 256 inputs being a single bit. The 256 inputs are provided as a single 256-bit wide input vector. An 8-bit selector (sel) is used to pick which bit from the 256-bit input vector will be the output.

### Detailed Requirements:
1. **Data Input**:
   - `in`: A 256-bit wide input vector, where each bit represents an individual input to the multiplexer.
   - For instance, `in[0]` is the first bit, `in[1]` is the second bit, up to `in[255]`, the 256th bit.

2. **Selector Input**:
   - `sel`: An 8-bit wide input selector.
   - This selector value (ranging from 0 to 255) determines which corresponding bit in the 256-bit wide input vector is to be routed to the output.
   - For example, if `sel` is 8'h00 (which signifies decimal 0), the output should be `in[0]`; if `sel` is 8'h01 (which signifies decimal 1), the output should be `in[1]`; and for `sel` 8'hFF (255 in decimal), the output should be `in[255]`.

3. **Output**:
   - `out`: A single-bit output which corresponds to the selected bit from the input vector based on the value of `sel`.

### Implementation Guidance:
- Direct indexing using a variable index on a vector of bits in Verilog is permitted and will infer the correct hardware for synthesis. Thus, effectively employing `in[sel]` can be useful.
- Due to the extensive number of inputs, a case or if-else statement might not be the best approach. Instead, leveraging the flexibility of Verilog's features to directly index into the input vector using the selector is advisable.

### Verilog Module Skeleton:
Below is the basic skeleton of the Verilog module where your implementation code will be added.

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input [255:0] in,    // 256-bit input vector
    input [7:0] sel,     // 8-bit selector
    output out          // 1-bit output
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Ensure that your implementation inside the module correctly adheres to the requirements and effectively uses Verilog's abilities to achieve the desired functionality. The `out` should indeed reflect the selected bit from the 256-bit input vector based on the value of `sel`.
