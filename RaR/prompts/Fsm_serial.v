Sure, here is a revised version of the question with additional details and context for clarity:

---

In many older serial communication protocols, data transfer occurs one byte at a time, often with additional bits called start and stop bits to help the receiving system correctly identify and delimit each byte within the continuous stream of bits. A commonly used scheme involves the following structure:

- 1 start bit (logic 0)
- 8 data bits (the actual information being sent)
- 1 stop bit (logic 1)
- When no data is being transmitted, the communication line remains at logic 1 (idle state).

Design a finite state machine (FSM) using Verilog to identify when a byte of data has been correctly received within a stream of bits. The FSM should operate as follows:
- Identify the start bit (logic 0) to mark the beginning of a new byte.
- Sequentially read the next 8 bits as the data byte.
- Verify the presence of the stop bit (logic 1) immediately after the 8 data bits.

If the stop bit is correct, the FSM should signal that the byte has been successfully received. If the stop bit is not detected as expected, the FSM should discard the current byte and wait until it finds a valid stop bit before it starts looking for the next start bit to begin the process again.

Implement your design using a Verilog module with the following interface:
- `clk` (input): The clock signal to synchronize the FSM.
- `in` (input): The incoming stream of bits.
- `reset` (input): A synchronous reset signal to initialize the FSM.
- `done` (output): A signal that indicates a byte has been correctly received.

Here is the module declaration to get you started:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output done
); 

    // Insert your Verilog code here.

endmodule
```

Clarify the detailed specification and functioning of the FSM, ensuring that it correctly transitions through states for identifying the start bit, reading data bits, and verifying the stop bit, and handles errors accordingly.
