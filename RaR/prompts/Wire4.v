To clarify and elaborate on the essence of your question, I'm going to restate it with additional details and context:

You are tasked with designing a Verilog module named `top_module` that has three input signals (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and four output signals (`w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`). The functionality of the module should be such that it directly connects each input signal to specific output signals in the following manner:
- The input signal `a` should be connected to the output signal `w`.
- The input signal `b` should be connected to both output signals `x` and `y`.
- The input signal `c` should be connected to the output signal `z`.

To implement these direct connections, you may find the Verilog concatenation operator `{ ... }` useful. The concatenation operator can combine multiple signals into a single vector, which can help streamline the assignment process.

Here is the initial framework of the Verilog module that you should complete:

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c, 
    output w, 
    output x, 
    output y, 
    output z 
);

// Insert your code here to create the specified connections

endmodule
```

To summarize, please ensure your Verilog code within this module establishes the specified input-to-output connections accurately. Consider leveraging the concatenation operator where it might simplify your code.
