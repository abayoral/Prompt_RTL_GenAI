You are tasked with designing a 32-bit carry-select adder by utilizing the provided `add16` module, which performs the addition of two 16-bit numbers while accounting for a carry-in input and producing a 16-bit sum along with a carry-out output. The `add16` module is defined as follows:

```verilog
module add16 (
    input [15:0] a, 
    input [15:0] b, 
    input cin, 
    output [15:0] sum, 
    output cout 
);
```

Your goal is to instantiate three `add16` modules within a module named `top_module`. The `top_module` will accept two 32-bit input vectors `a` and `b`, perform the overall addition, and generate a 32-bit result `sum`.

To accomplish this, follow these guidelines:

1. Divide the 32-bit inputs `a` and `b` into two 16-bit segments each.
2. Instantiate the first `add16` module to add the lower 16 bits of `a` and `b`, along with an assumed carry-in of 0.
3. Use the remaining two `add16` modules to add the upper 16 bits of `a` and `b` under two different scenarios: one assuming a carry-in of 0 and the other assuming a carry-in of 1.
4. Implement a 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer to select between the outputs of the two scenarios for the upper 16 bits, based on the carry-out from the lower 16-bit addition.

```verilog
module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);
    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Make sure to clearly connect the intermediate signals and properly link the carry-out from the lower 16-bit addition to the multiplexer control signal for selecting the correct upper 16-bit result.
