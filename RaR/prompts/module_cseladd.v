Your task involves the development of a specialized type of binary adder known as a carry-select adder. One of the crucial modules you will need to utilize in its construction is the add16 module. This particular module carries the ability to perform the addition of two different 16-bit numbers. In addition to this, it also accommodates a carry-in, brings forth a carry-out, and produces a 16-bit sum.

At this point, you should be aware that three separate instances of the add16 module are indispensable for the successful completion of your carry-select adder design.

A significant part of this task also consists of designing your own custom 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer. This self-created multiplexer is to be fully integrated into your total carry-select adder design.

To give you a clearer perspective, the add16 module has been previously declared as follows:

module add16 ( 
   input[15:0] a, 
   input[15:0] b, 
   input cin, 
   output[15:0] sum, 
   output cout 
);

You are expected to finalise your task with a top_module, which should exhibit the structure stated below:

module top_module(
   input [31:0] a,
   input [31:0] b,
   output [31:0] sum
);

Thus, posing the question: What would be the most efficient approach to start crafting the code that should be inserted here?
