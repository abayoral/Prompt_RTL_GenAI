Your project requires you to design a calculating circuit, an adder-subtractor, capable of conducting both addition and subtraction operations. For your convenience, a 16-bit adder module has been furnished, which you will need to use in your circuit design. 

The supplied 16-bit adder module is equipped with multiple inputs and outputs. This module hosts two independent 16-bit input numbers, termed as 'a' and 'b'. For functional representation, these are defined as 'input[15:0] a' and 'input[15:0] b'. An auxiliary input called 'cin', denoting the carry input, is also available. Concerning outputs, the module features a sum, expressed as 'output[15:0] sum', along with 'cout', indicating the carry output.

Your next phase in the project requires the incorporation of this 16-bit adder module twice into the adder-subtractor circuit. This is followed by the deployment of a 32-bit wide XOR gate to alter the 'b' input whenever the subtractor input, identified as "sub", is assigned a value of 1. You can visualize this conceptually as XORing 'b[31:0]' with the subtractor "sub", repeating the process 32 times.

The design also stipulates forging a connection between the subtractor 'sub' input and the adder's carry-in, cin. 

The fundamental or 'top' module of your prospective circuit will incorporate 'a' and 'b' inputs, both of lengths 32 bits, represented as 'input[31:0]a' and 'input[31:0]b'. It will also acknowledge the subtractor input, termed as 'sub', and a 32-bit output sum, depicted as 'output[31:0] sum'.

Another interesting design aspect to note is considering the XOR gate as a programmable inverter, which implies that one input can control whether the other one should be inverted or not.

Your task's portion that demands the creation of your exclusive code rests within this top module. This specifies that your principal focus should revolve around developing and integrating this unique code within the established complex or top module of the existing circuit framework.
