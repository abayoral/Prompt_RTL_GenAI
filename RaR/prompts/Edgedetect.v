Let's rephrase and elaborate on the question to make it clearer:

Develop a Verilog module named `top_module` that detects positive edge transitions on an 8-bit input vector. Each bit in this vector should be monitored independently to identify when a transition from 0 to 1 occurs between consecutive clock cycles. When such a transition is detected on any bit, the corresponding bit in the output vector `pedge` should be set to 1 during the next clock cycle. Consequently, the output bit should reflect the positive edge detection by being set high exactly one clock cycle after the transition from 0 to 1 occurs on the input bit.

Here is the interface for the module you need to implement:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,                // Clock signal
    input [7:0] in,           // 8-bit input vector to monitor for transitions
    output [7:0] pedge       // 8-bit output vector indicating positive edge detection
);
    // Insert your code here
endmodule
```

Please provide the Verilog code that implements this functionality within the given module.
