The given Verilog code describes a 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects between two 8-bit input vectors `a` and `b` based on a single-bit selection input `sel`. However, it seems that there might be an issue with the current implementation. Your task is to identify and correct any mistakes that prevent the multiplexer from working as intended. Specifically, examine the `assign` statement for potential logical or syntactical errors that could cause the selection mechanism to fail or lead to incorrect output assignments.

Here's the original example for reference:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output out
);

    assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);

endmodule
```

Please review this code and make the necessary modifications to ensure the multiplexer correctly outputs either `a` or `b` based on the value of `sel`, and ensure the output correctly supports 8-bit wide output as intended.
