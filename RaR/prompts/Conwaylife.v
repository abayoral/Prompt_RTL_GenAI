Certainly! Let's rephrase and expand the details of the problem scenario while providing additional clarification.

In this exercise, you are required to implement Conway's Game of Life using a hardware description language, specifically SystemVerilog. Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game that simulates the life and death of cells on a two-dimensional grid based on predefined rules.

### Game Rules and Grid Details:
1. **Grid Information**: The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells measuring 16x16. Therefore, there are 256 cells in total.
2. **Cell States**: Each cell in the grid is either alive (`1`) or dead (`0`).
3. **Neighbor Counting**: Each cell's state in the next time step depends on the number of alive neighbors it has.
    - **0-1 neighbors**: The cell dies of loneliness (`0`).
    - **2 neighbors**: The cell's state remains unchanged.
    - **3 neighbors**: The cell becomes alive due to reproduction (`1`).
    - **4 or more neighbors**: The cell dies of overcrowding (`0`).

### Toroid Grid Concept:
The grid wraps around both horizontally and vertically forming a toroid. This means:
- The cell at the top-left corner `(0,0)` has neighbors that include cells from the opposite edges of the grid.
- For instance, its neighbors include the cells from `(15,1)`, `(15,0)`, `(15,15)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,15)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,0)`, and `(1,15)`.

### Grid Representation:
The entire state of the 16x16 grid is represented as a single 256-bit vector where:
- `q[15:0]` represents row 0,
- `q[31:16]` represents row 1,
- ...
- `q[255:240]` represents row 15.

### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input `clk`**: The system clock.
- **Input `load`**: A control signal to load initial state data into the grid at the next rising edge of the clock.
- **Input `data [255:0]`**: A 256-bit vector containing the initial state of the grid.
- **Output `q [255:0]`**: A 256-bit vector representing the current state of the grid, which must be updated every clock cycle according to the Conway's Game of Life rules.

### Behavior:
- When `load` is asserted (`1`), the `data` should be loaded into `q` at the next clock edge.
- On each clock cycle where `load` is not asserted, the game state should advance by one timestep following the rules provided.

### Specific Test Case:
To test your implementation, you can initialize the grid using the blinker pattern represented by `256'h7`. This pattern involves three adjacent cells in a row being alive. Over successive timesteps, this pattern should oscillate between a horizontal row and a vertical column in the middle row and column positions, respectively.

### Module Definition:
```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [255:0] data,
    output [255:0] q ); 

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Your task is to implement the logic within this module so that it correctly simulates the Game of Life on a 16x16 toroidal grid, ensuring that the grid state is updated every clock cycle and can load initial state data as required.

Keep in mind that your solution should account for the wrapping nature of the grid to correctly count neighbors and apply the game rules accordingly.

### Implementation Details:
- Carefully handle the edge and corner cells due to the wrapping nature of the toroidal grid.
- Use a method to efficiently calculate the next state of each cell based on its current state and the states of its neighbors.
