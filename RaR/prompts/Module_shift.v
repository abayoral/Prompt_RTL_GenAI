Sure, here's an elaboration and rephrasing of the given task:

You are provided with a module named `my_dff`, which implements a D flip-flop. This module has two input ports: `clk` and `d`, and one output port: `q`. The D flip-flop updates its output `q` to the value of `d` on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`.

Using the `my_dff` module, your task is to create another module named `top_module`. Within `top_module`, you need to instantiate three instances of the `my_dff` module. These instances should be connected in a chain to form a shift register of length 3. This means that the output `q` of the first instance should be connected to the input `d` of the second instance, and the output `q` of the second instance should be connected to the input `d` of the third instance.

Additionally, ensure that the `clk` input port of each `my_dff` instance is connected to the `clk` input of the `top_module`.

Here is the module definition provided to you:

```verilog
module my_dff ( input clk, input d, output q );
```

You need to implement the `top_module` as follows:

```verilog
module top_module ( input clk, input d, output q );
    // Insert your code here to instantiate three my_dff modules
    // and chain them together to create a shift register of length 3.
endmodule
```

To summarize, your objective is to:

1. Instantiate three `my_dff` modules within `top_module`.
2. Connect the `clk` port of each `my_dff` instance to the `clk` port of `top_module`.
3. Chain the instances by connecting the output `q` of one instance to the input `d` of the next instance.
4. Ensure the final output `q` of the shift register is correctly assigned.

In this way, you will create a 3-stage shift register using the provided D flip-flop module.
