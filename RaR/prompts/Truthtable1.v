To create a combinational circuit that implements the provided truth table for a three-input, one-output function, consider the truth table's structure:

- The truth table has 8 rows, corresponding to the 8 possible combinations of the three inputs (x3, x2, x1).
- Each row in the truth table indicates whether the output (f) is 0 or 1 for that specific combination of inputs.
- In this specific truth table, the output (f) is 1 for four specific input combinations, and 0 for the remaining four combinations.

Here is the truth table in more detail:

| Row Number | x3 | x2 | x1 | f |
|------------|----|----|----|---|
| 0          |  0 |  0 |  0 | 0 |
| 1          |  0 |  0 |  1 | 0 |
| 2          |  0 |  1 |  0 | 1 |
| 3          |  0 |  1 |  1 | 1 |
| 4          |  1 |  0 |  0 | 0 |
| 5          |  1 |  0 |  1 | 1 |
| 6          |  1 |  1 |  0 | 0 |
| 7          |  1 |  1 |  1 | 1 |

Your task is to design a combinational circuit that reflects this truth table. 

A recommended approach is to use the sum-of-products method:

- In the sum-of-products form, you use AND gates to detect specific input combinations that result in an output of 1.
- Specifically, you will use an AND gate for each row in the truth table where the output is 1.
- Then, combine the results of these AND gates using an OR gate, which will produce the desired output.

For this specific example, the output (f) is 1 for the following input combinations (rows):

- Row 2: x3=0, x2=1, x1=0
- Row 3: x3=0, x2=1, x1=1
- Row 5: x3=1, x2=0, x1=1
- Row 7: x3=1, x2=1, x1=1

Therefore, you need to create a combinational logic circuit using 4 three-input AND gates and combine their outputs using a four-input OR gate.

Based on this, you are to implement this logic in a Verilog module specified below. Ensure the logic correctly reflects the truth table by forming each AND gate that matches the given rows of the table and then combining them through the OR gate.

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input x3,
    input x2,
    input x1,  // three inputs
    output f   // one output
);

    // Insert your code here

endmodule
```

Make sure to express your logic clearly and handle each input combination appropriately to achieve the correct output.
