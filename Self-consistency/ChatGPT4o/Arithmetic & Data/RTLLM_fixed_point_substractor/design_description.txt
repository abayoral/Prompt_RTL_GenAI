Assume you are working in a context where you have been provided with data up to October 2023, and your task requires you to deploy your expertise as a seasoned Verilog designer. Your specific mission is to construct a module tasked with performing fixed-point arithmetic operations, specifically subtraction, with a defined and unyielding precision level. This involves precise handling of both integer and fractional components of the numerical values involved.

The module you are to design will be denoted as `fixed_point_subtractor`. This module must be adaptable and customizable based on certain parameters that dictate the configuration of the data being processed. The parameters include `Q`, which specifies the number of bits dedicated to representing the fractional part of the fixed-point number, and `N`, which dictates the overall number of bits—encompassing both integer and fractional parts—that the inputs and outputs can use.

For input ports, your module will receive two operands:
- `a [N-1:0]`: This is the first fixed-point input operand, encompassing N bits.
- `b [N-1:0]`: The second fixed-point input operand, similarly represented with N bits.

Upon execution, the module is expected to furnish the following output:
- `c [N-1:0]`: This output is the result of the fixed-point subtraction, maintaining the same N-bit structure.

To facilitate the subtraction process internally, the module will employ an internal register:
- `res [N-1:0]`: This register temporarily holds the subtraction result, allowing for further processing and adjustments before the final output is generated.

The implementation requires addressing several scenarios and ensuring specific behaviors:
- In cases where both input operands `a` and `b` possess the same sign, their respective integer and fractional components are directly subtracted. The resulting sign should mirror that of the input operands.
- When `a` and `b` display different signs, a different approach is necessary:
  - If `a` is positive and `b` negative, the operation involves adding their absolute values. The sign of the resulting value depends on whether the absolute value of `a` surpasses or falls short of `b`.
  - Conversely, if `a` is negative and `b` positive, the same logic of absolute value addition applies. The resultant sign hinges on a comparative assessment of their magnitudes.

Furthermore, the implementation must include a mechanism to handle cases where the result equates to zero. In such instances, proactive measures should be taken to explicitly set the sign bit to zero, thus accurately reflecting the neutral value.

The accuracy and precision of the operation are governed by the parameters `Q` and `N`. This ensures that the subtraction yields correct results, preserving the precision of fractional computations alongside the overall numeric integrity.

Your task is to develop a comprehensive Verilog code that encapsulates these specifications, facilitating seamless fixed-point subtraction with the defined precision constraints. Focus on precision, sign handling, and the correct representation of zero, while considering the impacts and outcomes derived from the parameterized configurations.
