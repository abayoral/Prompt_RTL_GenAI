// you're a senior Digital Design Engineer at a leading hardware design company tasked with developing a critical Verilog module for a next-generation product. The success of this module is pivotal for maintaining my computer hardware company's reputation in the industry.

// Given four unsigned numbers, find the minimum. 
// Unsigned numbers can be compared with standard comparison operators (a < b). 
// Use the conditional operator to make two-way min circuits, 
// then compose a few of them to create a 4-way min circuit. 
// You'll probably want some wire vectors for the intermediate results.

module top_module (
    input [7:0] a, b, c, d,
    output [7:0] min);//

    // Insert your code below
    // assign intermediate_result1 = compare? true: false;

endmodule
