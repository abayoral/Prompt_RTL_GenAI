As a skilled Verilog designer with expertise in digital hardware design and implementation, please assist with the following task:

Develop a Verilog module named "div_16bit" that performs the division of a 16-bit dividend by an 8-bit divisor using combinational logic. The primary goal of this implementation is to accurately generate a 16-bit quotient and a 16-bit remainder. Here are additional details and specifications for the task:

1. The division process involves examining the higher-order bits of the 16-bit dividend. Specifically, extract a subset of the dividend bits such that their number matches the bit width of the divisor, which is 8 bits in this case.

2. Conduct a size comparison between this 8-bit portion of the dividend and the entire 8-bit divisor. If the extracted dividend bits are numerically greater than the divisor, a binary '1' should be assigned to the current position in the resulting quotient.

3. Compute the difference between these 8-bit dividend bits and the divisor when the dividend bits are greater, then record this difference as the intermediate remainder for this stage.

4. Attach or concatenate this intermediate remainder with the highest remaining unprocessed bit from the dividend, thereby forming a new, augmented divisor for subsequent comparisons.

5. Repeat the above comparisons and calculations, shifting through the dividend bits, until the entire 16-bit dividend has been processed, ensuring that all bits contribute to the eventual quotient or remainder.

Input and Output Specifications:

- The module should contain input ports "A" and "B," where "A" is a 16-bit wide dividend and "B" is an 8-bit wide divisor.

- The output should consist of two 16-bit wide ports named "result" for the quotient and "odd" for the remainder, providing a comprehensive output of the division process.

Implementation Insight:

- Employ two always blocks within the module. Both are combinational in nature and depend on changes in inputs "A" and "B."

  * The first always block should carefully manage the loading of the input values into appropriate registers (e.g., a_reg and b_reg), used for storing and processing the dividend and divisor values respectively.

  * The second always block should orchestrate the control flow of the iterative division process, ensuring bit comparisons, assignment of quotient bits, and computation of the remainder are conducted accurately with every valid set of inputs.

By following these guidelines, please proceed to write a complete Verilog code implementing the "div_16bit" module with these functional requirements and signal specifications.
