As a professional Verilog designer, your task is to develop a Verilog module that performs subtraction on fixed-point numbers with a defined precision. This module is crucial for applications requiring precise arithmetic operations where both integer and fractional parts of numbers must be considered. Here, the requirement is to implement a module named `fixed_point_subtractor` with specific parameterized values for flexibility in defining precision levels.

**Module Parameters:**

- **Q**: This parameter sets the number of bits dedicated to representing the fractional part of the fixed-point number. It defines the level of precision available for fractional calculations.
- **N**: This parameter specifies the total number of bits used for the entire fixed-point number, which includes both integer and fractional parts combined. It determines the overall size and range of values the inputs and outputs can represent.

**Input Ports:**

- **a [N-1:0]**: An N-bit wide port, this represents the first operand for the subtraction. It contains both the integer and fractional components as defined by the parameter N.
- **b [N-1:0]**: Similar to port a, this N-bit wide port represents the second operand, which will be subtracted from the first one.

**Output Ports:**

- **c [N-1:0]**: This port will output the result of the fixed-point subtraction operation in the same N-bit format, maintaining both integer and fractional precision.

**Internal Registers:**

- **res [N-1:0]**: A temporary storage space within the module used to hold the intermediate result of the subtraction operation before assigning it to the output port.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Subtraction with Same Signs**: When both operands a and b have the same sign (either both positive or both negative), their fractional and integer parts are directly subtracted. The resulting sign will be the same as that of the operands.

2. **Subtraction with Different Signs**: 
   - **Positive a and Negative b**: The absolute values of a and b are added together. The result will retain a positive sign if the absolute value of a exceeds that of b, and a negative sign if otherwise.
   - **Negative a and Positive b**: Conversely, if a is negative and b is positive, their absolute values are also added. The sign of the result depends on which operand has the larger absolute value.

3. **Handling Zero Outputs**: An important edge case to address is when the arithmetic result is zero, where the sign bit must explicitly be set to 0 to ensure clarity and correctness in representation.

4. **Precision Management**: The fixed-point arithmetic precision is carefully managed by the parameters Q and N. These ensure that both integer and fractional parts are represented accurately, preserving the desired numerical fidelity in calculations.

For this task, your objective is to write the complete Verilog code for the `fixed_point_subtractor` module, incorporating these specifications and handling all edge cases.
