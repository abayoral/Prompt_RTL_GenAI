Design a module capable of performing binary addition on two 100-bit numbers along with an additional carry-in input. Specifically, this module should accept three inputs: two 100-bit binary numbers (a and b), as well as a single binary carry-in (cin). The desired outputs should include a 100-bit result of the sum of these inputs and a single carry-out bit that represents any overflow into the 101st bit.

By employing a behavioral approach to coding, bypass the necessity of instantiating a prohibitively large number of full adders, which would typically be required if creating the adder through structural modeling. This entails using a high-level representation that describes the functionality needed to perform addition, rather than manually connecting individual bit-level components. Keep in mind that such a design would involve computing the sum and carry operations not just for each bit position but also collectively ensuring correct propagation of carry values through the 100 bits.

Please clarify the implementation within the framework of the top_module as specified: delineate how you would write your logic to perform this operation within this modular structure, keeping in mind Verilog syntactic conventions and best practices.
