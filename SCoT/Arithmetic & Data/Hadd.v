The task at hand is to design and implement a digital circuit module, commonly referred to as a 'half adder,' within the Verilog hardware description language. This module is to be named `top_module`. The primary function of a half adder is to perform the addition of two single-bit binary numbers, which in this case are represented by the inputs `a` and `b`. It should be noted that in a half adder, there is no input for a carry-in bit, meaning that the addition operation starts with these two bits alone. The outputs of this half adder circuit should include two specific binary results: 

1. The `sum` (output) which represents the least significant bit of the addition of the two input bits `a` and `b`.
2. The `cout` (carry-out) which indicates whether there is a carry-out from the sum operation. This output is critical in determining whether the addition has resulted in an overflow, which in binary addition means a binary '1' is carried over to the next higher bit position.

Your objective is to fill in the necessary Verilog code within the `top_module` to correctly implement these functionalities and behaviors. Ensure that the logic within the module adheres to the principles of a half adder, using appropriate Verilog constructs and operators to achieve the desired outputs based on the binary addition logic.
