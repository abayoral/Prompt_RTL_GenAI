As an experienced Verilog designer, you are tasked with creating a Verilog module named `fixed_point_adder` which implements a parameterized fixed-point adder for arithmetic operations characterized by fixed precision. Below are the specific details and parameters you need to consider for this implementation:

**Module Details:**
- **Module Name:** `fixed_point_adder`

**Input Parameters:**
- **Q (integer):** Represents the number of fractional bits, which directly influences the precision of the fixed-point representation. This parameter dictates how many bits are used after the binary point.
- **N (integer):** Denotes the total number of bits utilized for each input, which includes both the integer and fractional parts of the fixed-point numbers.

**Input Ports:**
- **a [N-1:0]:** The first input operand in a fixed-point N-bit format. This operand serves as one of the values in the arithmetic operation.
- **b [N-1:0]:** The second input operand in the same fixed-point N-bit format as `a`. This operand is the other value involved in the arithmetic operation.

**Output Ports:**
- **c [N-1:0]:** The output port that delivers the result of the fixed-point addition operation. The result should be in the same N-bit fixed-point format to maintain consistency in size and precision.

**Internal Registers:**
- **res [N-1:0]:** An internal N-bit register used temporarily to store the intermediary or final result of the addition/subtraction operation within the module.

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Absolute Value Addition:**
   - This step is performed when the MSBs (sign bits) of both operands `a` and `b` are identical, indicating that both numbers are either positive or negative.
   - The absolute values of `a` and `b` are added together. The result's sign bit should be set to match the common sign bit of `a` and `b`, ensuring the continuity of the sign.

2. **Absolute Value Subtraction:**
   - This occurs when the MSBs of `a` and `b` differ, suggesting that one operand is positive while the other is negative.
   - Compare the absolute values:
     - If `a` has a greater absolute value than `b`, compute `a - b`. The resultant MSB should stand as 0, indicating a positive result.
     - If `b` is greater than `a`, compute `b - a`. The resultant sign should appropriately reflect whether the result is negative or zero.

3. **Precision Management:**
   - The fixed-point operands, `a` and `b`, include both integer and fractional components. The fractional component comprises `Q` bits, holding significance for the precision of computations.
   - Precision consistency needs to be maintained across input operands and the output to guarantee the accuracy of the arithmetic operations.

4. **Overflow Handling:**
   - Overflow considerations are crucial to ensure that the outcome of the fixed-point operation does not exceed the allocated N-bit range.
   - Monitor the MSB for overflow indications, making sure the results adhere to the specified N-bit limit.
