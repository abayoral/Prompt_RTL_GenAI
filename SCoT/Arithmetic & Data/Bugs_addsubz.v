You have provided a segment of Verilog code intended for simulating an 8-bit adder-subtractor circuit with an implemented zero flag. This module is supposed to perform either an addition or subtraction based on the input `do_sub` signal, where a `0` implies addition and a `1` implies subtraction between two 8-bit inputs, `a` and `b`. The calculation result is stored in the output `out`, while another output, `result_is_zero`, is intended to indicate whether the computed result in `out` is zero.

However, the code you've given seems to have functional issues since the zero flag (result_is_zero) doesn't behave as intended. Your task is to identify and correct any bugs in this code to ensure that both the arithmetic operation (addition or subtraction) and the zero flag work correctly. In doing so, pay attention to conditional statements, signal assignments, and any potential logical oversights that could affect the accuracy of both the `out` and `result_is_zero` outputs. How would you approach diagnosing and resolving the issues to ensure that the zero flag correctly represents a zero result from the arithmetic operation, accommodating both possible operations depending on the `do_sub` input?
