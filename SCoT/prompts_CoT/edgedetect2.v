//Using Chain of Thought:

// For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from one clock cycle to the next (detect any edge). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] anyedge
);

	// Insert your code here

endmodule

//Please understand the requirement and write a rough solving process. It starts with a input-output structure, then defines intermediate signals. The thought process should be explained in pseudocode with no Verilog modules or syntax whatsoever. The necessary details should be written in natural languages.
