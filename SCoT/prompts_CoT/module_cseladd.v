//Using Chain of Thought:

// you are provided with the same module add16 as the previous exercise, 
// which adds two 16-bit numbers with carry-in and produces a carry-out and 16-bit sum. 
// You must instantiate three of these to build the carry-select adder, 
// using your own 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer.

// Connect the modules together as shown in the diagram below. 
// The provided module add16 has the following declaration:

module add16 ( input[15:0] a, input[15:0] b, input cin, output[15:0] sum, output cout );

module top_module(
    input [31:0] a,
    input [31:0] b,
    output [31:0] sum
);

// Insert your code here

endmodule

//Please understand the requirement and write a rough solving process. It starts with a input-output structure, then defines intermediate signals. The thought process should be explained in pseudocode with no Verilog modules or syntax whatsoever. The necessary details should be written in natural languages.
