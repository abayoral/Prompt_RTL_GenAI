Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The task is to create a 100-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer, where the multiplexer selects between two 100-bit input vectors (a and b) based on a single control signal (sel).
        When sel is 0, the output should be the value of a.
        When sel is 1, the output should be the value of b.
    
    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a[99:0], b[99:0], sel
        Output: out[99:0]
    
    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed because the logic is straightforward and can be implemented directly using a ternary operator.
    
    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use an assign statement to define the output (out).
        The assign statement employs the ternary operator to set out based on the value of sel.
        If sel is 0, out is assigned the value of a.
        If sel is 1, out is assigned the value of b.
