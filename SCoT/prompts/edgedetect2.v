Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A module is needed that detects a change (any edge) in an 8-bit input signal from one clock cycle to the next. 
        Each output bit should be set high a cycle after a 0 to 1 transition on the corresponding input bit.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: clk, in[7:0]
        Outputs: anyedge[7:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        An intermediate signal, prev_in[7:0], is required to store the input signal from the previous clock cycle. It is used to compare with the current input signal and identify any changes.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Declare the intermediate 8-bit signal, prev_in, for storing the state of the input signal from the previous clock cycle.
        Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to implement the edge detection logic.
        Inside the always block, assign the current input signal to the previous input signal due to the delay.
        Use bitwise logic to find any change in signal from 0 to 1. For the current input and the negation of the previous input, perform a bitwise operation to find a rising edge.
        Assign the result to the anyedge output, which gets activated a clock cycle after a bit in the input signal goes from 0 to 1.
