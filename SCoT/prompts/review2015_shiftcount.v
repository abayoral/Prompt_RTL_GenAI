Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need to design a 4-bit shift register that also functions as a down-counter.
   - The inputs include a clock signal (clk), a shift enable signal (shift_ena), a count enable signal (count_ena), and input data for shifting.
   - Outputs will be a 4-bit register (q).
   - The system does not use both control signals (shift_ena and count_ena) at the same time, so the behavior when both are active is undefined and doesnâ€™t need special handling.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: clk, shift_ena, count_ena, data
   - Outputs: q[3:0]

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No specific intermediate signals are needed but consider how the shifting and counting will affect the internal state of the register.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to handle the shift and count operations.
   - Inside the always block, use a conditional structure to check the state of shift_ena and count_ena.
     - If shift_ena is high (1), perform the shift operation:
       - Shift the contents of the register left by one bit.
       - Assign the input data to the least significant bit of the register.
     - If count_ena is high (1), perform the decrement operation:
       - Decrement the value of the register.

5. **Pseudocode:**
   - Begin module declaration with inputs and outputs.
   - Always block on the rising edge of the clock.
   - Inside the always block:
     - If shift_ena is high, perform a left shift and input the data into the least significant bit of the register.
     - If count_ena is high, decrement the register value.
     - Note that there is no action defined for the case when both shift_ena and count_ena are high, as per the problem statement.

This structured approach will lead to an efficient combination of a shift register and a down counter within a single Verilog module.
