Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A Moore state machine generates an output solely based on the current state, not on the input.
        It has one input (in), one 2-bit state input (current state), one 2-bit next state output (next_state), and one output (out).
        There are four states, each encoded with 2 bits:
            A = 2'b00 (0)
            B = 2'b01 (1)
            C = 2'b10 (2)
            D = 2'b11 (3)
        The output and state transition are defined by the state transition table.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: 
            - in: a single-bit input signal
            - state: a 2-bit input signal representing the current state
        Outputs: 
            - next_state: a 2-bit output signal representing the next state
            - out: a single-bit output signal

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        Intermediate signals are not required as the next state and output can be directly derived from the current state and input.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        
        Transition Logic:
        - Use combinational logic (e.g., case statements) to determine the next state based on the current state and the input (in).
        - For each case of the current state:
            - If the state is A:
                - If in == 0, next_state = A
                - If in == 1, next_state = B
            - If the state is B:
                - If in == 0, next_state = C
                - If in == 1, next_state = B
            - If the state is C:
                - If in == 0, next_state = A
                - If in == 1, next_state = D
            - If the state is D:
                - If in == 0, next_state = C
                - If in == 1, next_state = B
        
        Output Logic:
        - Determine the output value (out) based on the current state:
            - If the state is A, out = 0
            - If the state is B, out = 0
            - If the state is C, out = 0
            - If the state is D, out = 1
        
        Ensure the logic is structured to handle any possible state transitions based on the given state transition table.
