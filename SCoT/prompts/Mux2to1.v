# Chain of Thought:

## Understand the Requirements:
- We need to create a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer.
- This multiplexer has to select one of the two inputs (a or b) based on the value of a select signal (sel).
- If sel is 0, the output (out) should be equal to input a.
- If sel is 1, the output (out) should be equal to input b.

## Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- Inputs: 
  - a: one-bit input
  - b: one-bit input
  - sel: one-bit select signal input

- Output: 
  - out: one-bit output which is the result of the multiplexer logic

## Define Intermediate Signals:
- We don't need any intermediate signals for this module, as the multiplexer logic is straightforward.

## Structuring the Module:
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - Declare the module with its inputs and outputs.

2. **Implementing the Multiplexer Logic:**
   - Use an assign statement to determine the output (out).
   - Use a ternary conditional operator in the assign statement to set 'out' based on the value of 'sel'.
     - If sel is 0, assign 'a' to 'out'.
     - If sel is 1, assign 'b' to 'out'.

This approach ensures that the output will always reflect the selected input based on the value of the select signal, efficiently implemented using a concise ternary operator.
