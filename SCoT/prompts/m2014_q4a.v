Task: Generate a Verilog module for a D flip-flop with an enable signal.

Please understand the requirement and write a rough solving process. It starts with an input-output structure, then defines intermediate signals. The thought process should be explained in pseudocode with no Verilog modules or syntax whatsoever. The necessary details should be written in natural languages.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - This module is a D flip-flop with an enable signal (ena).
    - The flip-flop captures the value of the data input (d) based on the enable signal (ena).
    - When ena is high (1), the flip-flop captures and holds the value of d.
    - When ena is low (0), the output (q) retains its previous value.
    - Note: This is a latch, so we expect a Quartus warning about having inferred a latch.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: d (data), ena (enable).
    - Output: q (output).

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are needed; the logic can be directly implemented in the always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block that is sensitive to changes in the enable signal (ena) or the data input (d).
    - Inside the always block, use an if statement to check the value of ena:
        - If ena is high (1), assign the value of d to q.
        - If ena is low (0), do nothing, thus retaining the previous value of q.

This process helps in systematically structuring the module and ensuring that all requirements are met.
