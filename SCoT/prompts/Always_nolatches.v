Understanding the problem requirements and generating a rough solving process for a Verilog module to recognize PS/2 keyboard arrow key scancodes:

### Chain of Thought:

**Understand the Requirements:**
- We need to detect which arrow key has been pressed based on the last two bytes of scancodes received from a PS/2 keyboard.
- Given scancodes:
  - `16'he06b`: left arrow
  - `16'he072`: down arrow
  - `16'he074`: right arrow
  - `16'he075`: up arrow
  - Any other scancode: no arrow key is pressed.
- Inputs: `scancode` (16-bit)
- Outputs: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` (all 1-bit)

**Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
- Input: `scancode` (16-bit)
- Outputs: `left`, `down`, `right`, `up` (each 1-bit)

**Define Intermediate Signals:**
- No intermediate signals are needed for this straightforward mapping.

**Structuring the Module:**
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - Define the module with one 16-bit input (`scancode`) and four 1-bit outputs (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`).
   
2. **Default Value Assignment:**
   - Initialize all outputs (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) to zero before processing the scancode to ensure no latches are created and all outputs are always assigned.

3. **Case Statement for Scancode Mapping:**
   - Use a `case` statement to check the value of `scancode`.
   - Inside the `case` statement, for each matching scancode, assign the corresponding output to `1`.
   - For any other scancode (default case), leave all outputs as `0`.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Begin with the module declaration specifying the inputs and outputs.
2. Use an `always @(*)` block for combinational logic:
   - Initialize `left`, `down`, `right`, and `up` to `0`.
   - Use a `case` statement to handle each specific scancode:
     - For `16'he06b`, set `left` to `1`.
     - For `16'he072`, set `down` to `1`.
     - For `16'he074`, set `right` to `1`.
     - For `16'he075`, set `up` to `1`.
   - In the default case, ensure no change is made since outputs have already been initialized to `0`.

By following these detailed steps, the recognition of PS/2 keyboard arrow key scancodes can be efficiently implemented while ensuring that all conditions are handled properly without creating any unwanted latches.
