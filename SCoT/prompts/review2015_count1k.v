Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - The counter should count from 0 to 999 (inclusive).
    - The counter should wrap around to 0 after reaching 999, making the period 1000 cycles.
    - The reset input should be synchronous, meaning the counter should reset to 0 on the next clock cycle when the reset signal is high.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:**
        - `clk` (clock input)
        - `reset` (synchronous reset input)
    - **Outputs:**
        - `q[9:0]` (10-bit output for the counter value, which can represent values from 0 to 999)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are strictly needed for this straightforward counter design, as the logic can be directly implemented inside an always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - **Module Declaration:**
        - Specify the inputs and outputs in the module declaration.
    - **Always Block:**
        - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to implement the counter logic.
        - **Handling the Reset:**
            - Inside the always block, first check if the reset signal is high.
            - If the reset signal is high, set `q` to 0 to reset the counter.
        - **Incrementing the Counter:**
            - If the reset signal is low, increment the value of `q` by 1 on each rising edge of the clock.
        - **Wrapping Around:**
            - Check if `q` has reached its maximum value of 999. If it has, reset `q` to 0 on the next increment.

By following these steps, a hardware designer can enhance the performance and functionality of the language model tasked with generating a Verilog module for the given counter.
