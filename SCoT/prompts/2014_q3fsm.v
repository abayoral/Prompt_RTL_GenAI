Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - The FSM starts in a reset state called A.
    - It remains in state A as long as `s = 0`.
    - It moves to state B when `s = 1`.
    - In state B, the FSM examines the value of the input `w` for the next three clock cycles.
    - If `w = 1` for exactly two out of these three clock cycles, then the output `z` should be set to 1 in the following clock cycle.
    - Otherwise, `z` should be 0.
    - The FSM should continue this checking cycle as long as it is in state B.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `clk`, `reset`, `s`, `w`
    - Output: `z`

3. **Define Intermediate States and Signals**:
    - States:
        - `A`: Initial state, remains here as long as `s = 0`.
        - `B`: Active checking state, checks `w` for exactly two out of three clock cycles.
    - Signals:
        - `counter`: A counter to keep track of clock cycles within state B.
        - `w_count`: A counter to keep track of how many times `w = 1` within the three clock cycles.
        - `next_state`: To determine the next state of the FSM.
        - `current_state`: To hold the current state of the FSM.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - **Module Declaration**:
        - Declare the inputs `clk`, `reset`, `s`, `w`, and output `z`.
    - **State Definitions and Transitions**:
        - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock or the reset signal.
        - Define the initial state as `A` when reset.
        - In state `A`:
            - Remain in state `A` if `s = 0`.
            - Transition to state `B` if `s = 1`.
        - In state `B`:
            - Use a counter to track the number of cycles (`counter`).
            - Use another counter to track the number of times `w = 1` (`w_count`).
            - Check if `counter` reaches 3:
                - If `w_count` equals 2, set `z` to 1.
                - Otherwise, set `z` to 0.
            - Reset the `counter` and `w_count` for the next set of three clock cycles.
    - **Output Definitions**:
        - Assign `z` based on the logic defined in state `B`.

5. **Final Structure**:
    - Initialization of state and counters.
    - Always block for state transition and checking logic.
    - Conditional logic to handle state transitions and output assignment.
