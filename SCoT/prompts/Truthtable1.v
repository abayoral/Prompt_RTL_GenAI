Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        - We need to create a combinational circuit that implements the given truth table function.
        - The truth table has three inputs (x3, x2, x1), and one output (f).
        - The output (f) is '1' for inputs rows 2, 3, 5, and 7. For the other rows, the output is '0'.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        - Inputs: x3, x2, x1
        - Output: f

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        - Intermediate signals are needed to represent the conditions when each of the rows 2, 3, 5, and 7 are true. These signals will be the products (AND gates) that detect the specific input combinations.
        - Four intermediate signals can be defined to represent these conditions:
            - row_2_condition: true when x3=0, x2=1, x1=0
            - row_3_condition: true when x3=0, x2=1, x1=1
            - row_5_condition: true when x3=1, x2=0, x1=1
            - row_7_condition: true when x3=1, x2=1, x1=1

    Structuring the Module:
        - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        - Define the four intermediate signals using AND operations to check for each specified row's condition.
        - Use an OR operation to combine these intermediate signals, as the output (f) is '1' if any of these conditions are true.
        - Each intermediate signal will be defined as follows:
            - row_2_condition is true if x3 is 0, x2 is 1, and x1 is 0.
            - row_3_condition is true if x3 is 0, x2 is 1, and x1 is 1.
            - row_5_condition is true if x3 is 1, x2 is 0, and x1 is 1.
            - row_7_condition is true if x3 is 1, x2 is 1, and x1 is 1.
        - The final output (f) will be the OR of these intermediate conditions.

    Completing the Thought Process:
        - Ensure the module correctly declares input and output.
        - Make sure all intermediate signals are properly defined based on the truth table rows.
        - Finally, combine these intermediate signals to define the output (f).
