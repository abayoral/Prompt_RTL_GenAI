Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A 4-digit BCD counter is essentially a 16-bit counter with a special encoding: each group of four bits represent a decimal digit. 
        BCD is a binary coded decimal where each decimal digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, in this scenario, 4 bits.
        The ones digit is represented by q[3:0], tens digit is represented by q[7:4], hundreds digit is represented by q[11:8] and thousands digit by q[15:12].
        Enable signals (ena) are required to indicate when each of the upper three digits (tens, hundreds, thousands) should be incremented.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Input: clk, reset
        Output: ena[3:1], q[15:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        Using counters for each digit would be necessary. Once a counter reaches the maximum limit (i.e., 9 for decimal), it needs to be reset to 0 and an enable signal (ena) should be sent to increment the next digit.
        Intermediate signals such as carry flags (carry) may be required to handle the triggering of enable signals. 

    Structuring the Module:
        Begin with defining the module along with the required inputs and outputs.
        Create individual counters for each digit.
        Implement logic to increment each counter when clocked. The counters for digits [3:1] should increment when the enable input signal becomes high.
        Implement reset logic. On the active-high reset signal, reset the values of the counters to 0.
        In the event of a count reaching 9, reset the count to 0 and enable the increment of the next count.
        Implement the logic to determine when each of the upper three digits should be incremented. This will be based on if the previous digit has hit its maximum value (i.e., reached 9).
        Create the output, q, by concatenating the output from the individual counters. The order from MSB to LSB should be: thousands digit, hundreds digit, tens digit, ones digit.
        Output the enable signals which indicate when the upper three digits (i.e., digits [3:1]) should be incremented.
