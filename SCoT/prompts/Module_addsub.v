Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        We need to build an adder-subtractor for 32-bit inputs using the provided 16-bit adder module (`add16`).
        The `top_module` must handle both 32-bit addition and subtraction based on the control signal `sub`.
        Subtraction can be implemented by inverting the `b` input and adding 1 (two's complement).

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs to `top_module`: a[31:0], b[31:0], sub
        Output from `top_module`: sum[31:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        - Need two 16-bit outputs for the intermediate sums from the two 16-bit adders.
        - Need two 16-bit signals for the potentially inverted lower and upper parts of the `b` input.
        - Need signals to capture the carry-out of each 16-bit adder.

    Structuring the Module:
        1. Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        2. Split the inputs `a` and `b` into lower and upper 16 bits.
        3. Use an XOR gate to conditionally invert the `b` input based on the `sub` signal.
            - Create `b_inverted_lower` and `b_inverted_upper` by XORing the lower and upper 16 bits of `b` with the `sub` signal replicated 16 times.
        4. Connect the `sub` signal to the carry-in of the first `add16` instance for handling the initial addition or subtraction.
        5. Instantiate two `add16` modules:
            - The first instance handles the addition/subtraction of the lower 16 bits.
            - The second instance handles the addition/subtraction of the upper 16 bits, also considering the carry-out from the first instance.
        6. Capture the intermediate 16-bit sums and the carry-out.
        7. Concatenate the outputs of the two `add16` instances to form the final 32-bit sum.
