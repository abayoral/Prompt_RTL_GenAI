Chain of Thought:

Understand the Requirements:
A finite state machine (FSM) is required to control a motor based on inputs x, and y.
The FSM has a clock input, resetn, and outputs f and g.
The FSM needs to perform a sequence of operations controlled by these inputs.

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
Inputs: clk, x, y, resetn
Outputs: f, g

Define Intermediate Signals: 
Identify signals indicative of distinct states. These states include:
    - Initialized state (state A)
    - A state after the reset signal is de-asserted (State B)
    - States where the FSM monitors the values of x (State C)
    - A state after x produces the values 1,0,1 (State D)
    - States monitoring y (State E and F)
    - Final states depending on Y value (State G and H)

Structuring the Module:
Start with the module definition specifying the inputs and outputs.
Define the intermediate states of the FSM.
Create an always block that is triggered at the positive edge of the clock.
Inside the always block, implement a case statement for each state of the FSM.
State A - If reset is asserted, FSM is in the initialization state.
State B - Once reset is de-asserted, after the next clock edge, output f is set to 1.
State C - Monitor input x at every clock cycle.
State D - Once 1-0-1 sequence at the x input is captured, transition to the next state and set output g to 1.
State E - Monitor y while keeping g as 1.
States G & H - According to the value of y, keep g as 1 or set it back to 0 permanently.
Ensure that each case statement handles the transition to the appropriate next state based on the inputs and current states.
Remember to take care of the synchronization issues like metastability, by reading inputs at only one edge of the clock.
Also, make sure to never Mix blocking and non-blocking assignments in the same always block, it could create a race condition.
