Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - The FSM starts in state A as long as the reset signal (`resetn`) is asserted (active-low).
    - Once `resetn` is de-asserted, output `f` should be set to 1 for one clock cycle at the next clock edge.
    - After setting `f` to 1, the FSM starts monitoring the input `x` for the sequence `1, 0, 1` over three successive clock cycles.
    - Once the sequence `1, 0, 1` is detected, output `g` should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle.
    - While `g` is 1, the FSM then monitors input `y` for the value 1 within two clock cycles.
    - If `y` becomes 1 within these two cycles, `g` remains 1 until reset.
    - If `y` does not become 1 within these two cycles, `g` is set to 0 until reset.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `clk`, `resetn`, `x`, `y`
    - Outputs: `f`, `g`

3. **Define States and Transitions:**
    - State A: Initial state waiting for `resetn` to be de-asserted.
    - State B: Set `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.
    - State C: Monitor `x` for `1, 0, 1` sequence.
    - State D: Set `g` to 1 and start monitoring `y` for two clock cycles.
        - State D1: First clock cycle monitoring `y`.
        - State D2: Second clock cycle monitoring `y`.
    - State E: Set `g` to 0 permanently.

4. **Structuring the FSM:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Define an enumeration type for state encoding.
    - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to implement the FSM logic.
    - Inside the always block, include a reset condition that assigns the FSM to state A and initializes `f` and `g`.
    - Implement the transitions between states based on the conditions specified.
    - Manage output signals `f` and `g` within the respective states.

By carefully structuring the FSM and defining the necessary states and transitions, we ensure that the module meets the specified behavior and controls the motor correctly.
