Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        - The task requires designing a Verilog module with no inputs and one output that constantly outputs 0.
        - There are no inputs involved in this module.
        - The output should always be 0.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        - Inputs: None
        - Output: zero

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        - No intermediate signals are needed because the output is a constant value.

    Structuring the Module:
        - Start with the module declaration, specifying the output.
        - Declare the output signal "zero" in the port list.
        - Inside the module, assign the constant value 0 to the output signal "zero".
        - Since there's no need for any logic or state changes, a simple assign statement will suffice.
        - The assign statement will directly connect the constant 0 to the output signal "zero", ensuring it constantly outputs 0 without involving any other logic gates or components.
