Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - The digital system has four inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
    - The output of the system (`out_sop` and `out_pos`) depends on the values of these four inputs.
    - Specific input combinations generate a logic-1 output (2, 7, 15).
    - Other specific input combinations generate a logic-0 output (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14).
    - The input conditions for the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 never occur in this system.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`
    - Outputs: `out_sop`, `out_pos`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - Construct the expressions for both SOP (Sum of Products) and POS (Product of Sums) forms.
    - The SOP form is the OR of the AND gates that correspond to the minterms generating a logic-1 (2, 7, 15).
    - The POS form is the AND of the OR gates that correspond to the maxterms generating a logic-0 (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14).

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - For `out_sop`:
        - Identify the minterms for the numbers 2, 7, 15.
        - Construct the AND gates for these minterms by checking the binary equivalent values.
        - Use OR gates to connect these AND gates.
    - For `out_pos`:
        - Identify the maxterms for the numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14.
        - Construct the OR gates for these maxterms by checking the binary equivalent values.
        - Use AND gates to connect these OR gates.

5. **Mapping the Values**:
    - For minterms:
        - 2 -> (0010) means `a' b' c d'`
        - 7 -> (0111) means `a b' c' d`
        - 15 -> (1111) means `a b c d`
    - For maxterms (using de Morgan's laws for simplicity):
        - 0 -> (0000) means `a + b + c + d`
        - 1 -> (0001) means `a + b + c + d'`
        - 4 -> (0100) means `a + b' + c + d`
        - 5 -> (0101) means `a + b' + c + d'`
        - 6 -> (0110) means `a + b' + c' + d`
        - 9 -> (1001) means `a' + b + c + d'`
        - 10 -> (1010) means `a' + b + c' + d`
        - 13 -> (1101) means `a' + b' + c + d'`
        - 14 -> (1110) means `a' + b' + c' + d`

6. **Constructing the expressions**:
    - **SOP Expression**:
        - Combine the minterms using OR operations.
    - **POS Expression**:
        - Combine the maxterms using AND operations.

By following these steps, the details and proper use of logic to generate the required Verilog module are ensured.
