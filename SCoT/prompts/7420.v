Chain of Thought:

Understand the Requirements:
- The task is to create a module that replicates the functionality of the 7420 chip.
- The 7420 chip contains two 4-input NAND gates.
- Each NAND gate takes four inputs and produces one output.
- Therefore, we have a total of 8 inputs and 2 outputs.

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- Inputs: p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d for the first NAND gate, and p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d for the second NAND gate.
- Outputs: p1y for the first NAND gate and p2y for the second NAND gate.

Define Intermediate Signals:
- No intermediate signals are needed since the outputs are directly generated from the NAND operations.

Structuring the Module:
- Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
- Implement the first 4-input NAND gate using an appropriate boolean operation.
  - Combine the first four inputs (p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d) using the NAND logic to produce p1y.
    - NAND logic means that p1y will be the negation of the AND operation over p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d.
- Implement the second 4-input NAND gate using the same approach.
  - Combine the second set of four inputs (p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d) using the NAND logic to produce p2y.
    - Similarly, p2y will be the negation of the AND operation over p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d.
