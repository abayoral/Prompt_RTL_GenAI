Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to build a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence `1101` in an input bit stream.
    - Once the sequence `1101` is detected, the output `start_shifting` should be set to `1` and remain `1` until a reset signal is received.

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `clk`, `reset`, `data`
    - Output: `start_shifting`

3. **Identify States and Transitions:**
    - Define states for the FSM to track the bit sequence:
        - `STATE_RESET`: Initial state or reset state
        - `STATE_S1`: First `1` detected
        - `STATE_S11`: Sequence `11` detected
        - `STATE_S110`: Sequence `110` detected
        - `STATE_S1101`: Sequence `1101` detected (final state where `start_shifting` is set to `1`)
    - Define transitions between these states based on input `data`.

4. **Describe State Transitions:**
    - In `STATE_RESET`, if `data` is `1`, move to `STATE_S1`.
    - In `STATE_S1`, if `data` is `1`, move to `STATE_S11`; if `data` is `0`, stay in `STATE_RESET`.
    - In `STATE_S11`, if `data` is `0`, move to `STATE_S110`; if `data` is `1`, stay in `STATE_S11`.
    - In `STATE_S110`, if `data` is `1`, move to `STATE_S1101`; if `data` is `0`, move to `STATE_RESET`.
    - In `STATE_S1101`, set `start_shifting` to `1` and stay in this state until reset.

5. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - Use an enumerated type or local parameters to define the states.
    - Use a state register to hold the current state of the FSM.
    - Define the next state logic based on the current state and input `data`.

6. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Define local parameters for each state.
    - Declare a register to store the current state.
    - Use an always block to handle the state transitions based on clock and reset.
    - Inside the always block, implement the state transition logic.
    - Use another always block or continuous assignment to set the `start_shifting` output based on the current state.

By following this structured approach, the FSM will be designed logically, ensuring proper detection of the sequence `1101` and setting the `start_shifting` signal correctly.
