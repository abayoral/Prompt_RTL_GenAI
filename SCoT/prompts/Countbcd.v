Chain of Thought: 

## Understand the Requirements
1. **4-digit BCD Counter**: The module should count in binary-coded decimal (BCD) format, meaning each decimal digit is represented using 4 bits.
2. **Digits Encoding**:
   - q[3:0] is the ones digit.
   - q[7:4] is the tens digit.
   - q[11:8] is the hundreds digit.
   - q[15:12] is the thousands digit.
3. **Enable Signals**:
    - The enable signals (ena[3:1]) indicate when each of the upper three digits should increment.
    - For example, ena[1] should be high when the ones digit rolls over from 9 to 0.

## Determine the Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: clk, reset
- **Output**: ena[3:1], q[15:0]

## Define Intermediate Signals
- Use internal signals to hold the values of the individual BCD digits.
- Use carry signals to manage the rollover condition for each digit.

## Structuring the Module
1. **Module Declaration**:
    - Specify inputs and outputs.
2. **Submodule Instantiation**:
    - Instantiate four one-digit decade counters. Each counting from 0 to 9 and automatically rolling over to 0 on reaching 9.
3. **Logic for Enable Signals**:
    - Calculate the enable signals (ena[3:1]) based on the digits' rollover conditions:
      - ena[1] = (q[3:0] == 4'b1001) // Rollover condition for ones digit.
      - ena[2] = (q[7:4] == 4'b1001) && ena[1] // Rollover condition for tens digit occurs if ena[1] triggers and tens digit reaches 9.
      - ena[3] = (q[11:8] == 4'b1001) && ena[2] // Similarly for hundreds digit.
4. **Behavioral Logic for Counting**:
     - Use `always` block triggered on rising edge of clk and synchronous active-high reset.
     - Each digit is incremented based on enable signals and the current value of the preceding digit.

## Execution Flow:
1. On reset, set all BCD digits to 0.
2. On each clock's rising edge:
   - Evaluate digits to check if they have reached their maximum (9).
   - If digit is at its max, reset to 0 and set enable for next higher digit.
   - If digit is not at max, simply increment it.
3. Update outputs accordingly.

This structuring effectively deals with the counting, ensuring the enable signals are updated properly to reflect when higher digits should increment. This approach also modularizes the counting logic by using submodule decade counters, making the design more maintainable.
