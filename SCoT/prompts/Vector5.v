Understand the Requirements:

- The task requires computing pairwise comparisons of five 1-bit signals (a, b, c, d, e).
- There will be 25 comparisons as each bit is compared with itself and all other bits.
- The output is a 25-bit vector, where each bit represents the result of one comparison.
- If two bits being compared are equal, the corresponding output bit should be 1, otherwise 0.
- The hint provides an example of how XNOR operation can be used to check for equality between two bits.

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:

- Inputs: a, b, c, d, e
- Output: 25-bit vector containing pairwise comparison results

Define Intermediate Signals:

- Intermediate signals are not compulsory because we can use direct assignments for pairwise comparisons.

Structuring the Module:

1. Begin with the module declaration that specifies the inputs and outputs.
2. Use the assign statement to define the 25-bit output vector through pairwise comparisons.
3. Perform the XNOR operation for each pair of inputs to populate the output vector.
4. Each element of the output vector is the result of the XNOR operation between the respective input bits.

Steps to Implement:

1. For each pair (including a bit with itself), compute the XNOR.
2. Assign the result of each XNOR to the corresponding bit in the output vector.

Mapping the Pairwise Comparisons:

- out[24] = a XNOR a (this will always be 1)
- out[23] = a XNOR b
- out[22] = a XNOR c
- out[21] = a XNOR d
- out[20] = a XNOR e
- out[19] = b XNOR a
- out[18] = b XNOR b (this will always be 1)
- out[17] = b XNOR c
- out[16] = b XNOR d
- out[15] = b XNOR e
- out[14] = c XNOR a
- out[13] = c XNOR b
- out[12] = c XNOR c (this will always be 1)
- out[11] = c XNOR d
- out[10] = c XNOR e
- out[9] = d XNOR a
- out[8] = d XNOR b
- out[7] = d XNOR c
- out[6] = d XNOR d (this will always be 1)
- out[5] = d XNOR e
- out[4] = e XNOR a
- out[3] = e XNOR b
- out[2] = e XNOR c
- out[1] = e XNOR d
- out[0] = e XNOR e (this will always be 1)

After mapping each comparison:

- Use a concatenation method or individual assignments to define the 25-bit output in one line.
- Ensure that the concatenation of results follows the correct order as per the mapping above.

Thus, the goal is to ensure all these steps are followed to accurately create a 25-bit output vector comprising results of all pairwise comparisons.
