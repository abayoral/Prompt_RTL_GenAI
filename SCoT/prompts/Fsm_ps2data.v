Understand the Requirements:
The task involves designing a finite state machine (FSM) that processes a continuous byte stream to identify and capture packets, specifically 3-byte PS/2 mouse messages. The FSM needs to recognize three-byte messages where the first byte has bit[3]=1. Additionally, the datapath must capture and output the 24-bit message whenever a packet is fully received, indicated by an 'out_bytes' signal that is valid when the 'done' signal is asserted.

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
Inputs:
- `clk`: The clock signal for synchronization.
- `in`: The incoming 8-bit byte stream.
- `reset`: A synchronous reset signal.
Outputs:
- `out_bytes`: The 24-bit signal containing the captured 3-byte message.
- `done`: A signal asserting the completion of receiving a 3-byte message.

Define Intermediate Signals:
We need the following intermediate signals:
1. State signals for the FSM to track the current state.
2. Temporary storage registers for capturing the incoming bytes.

Define States for FSM:
1. `IDLE`: Initial state where the FSM waits for a byte with bit[3]=1.
2. `BYTE1`: State indicating the first byte has been captured.
3. `BYTE2`: State indicating the second byte has been captured.
4. `BYTE3`: State where the third byte is captured and the packet is completed, setting the `done` signal.

Structuring the FSM and Datapath:
1. Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
2. Define FSM states using state encoding.
3. Create a sequential always block driven by the clock and reset to update state transitions based on the input conditions.
4. Use combinational logic to determine the next state and output `done`.
5. Implement the datapath to capture the bytes into the `out_bytes` registers based on the current state and input byte.
6. Ensure `out_bytes` holds the correct values corresponding to the 3-byte message when `done` is asserted.

Chain of Thought:
1. **Understanding the FSM Structure**:
   - Identify the requirement of transitioning between states based on the byte input values, specifically focusing on the bit[3] condition for identifying the start of a message.
   - Plan states to cover waiting, capturing bytes, and indicating message completion, utilizing the `done` signal.

2. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Clearly define `clk`, `in`, and `reset` as inputs.
   - Define `out_bytes` and `done` as outputs to ensure clarity in module interconnections.

3. **Intermediate Signals**:
   - Define state variables and temporary registers for capturing each byte as they arrive in sequence.
   - Use a 2-bit or 3-bit state variable depending on the number of states required.

4. **State Encoding and Transitions**:
   - `IDLE` state: Wait for a byte with bit[3]=1 to transition to `BYTE1`.
   - `BYTE1` state: Capture the first byte, and move to `BYTE2`.
   - `BYTE2` state: Capture the second byte, and move to `BYTE3`.
   - `BYTE3` state: Capture the third byte, assert `done`, then transition back to `IDLE` to process the next message.
   
5. **Sequential Logic**:
   - Write sequential logic in an always block sensitive to the clock and reset. Use if-else or case statements to handle state transitions.
   - Capture byte values in dedicated registers when transitioning to the respective states.

6. **Output Logic**:
   - Ensure `out_bytes` is updated in the correct order (maintaining byte positions) in the datapath.
   - Use the `done` signal to indicate the output is valid and contains a complete message.

This thought process should provide the essential steps and strategy for creating an effective FSM in Verilog along with a properly functional datapath to meet the requirements.
