Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A single D flip-flop captures the value of the data input (d) at the positive edge of the clock (clk) and holds this value until the next positive edge.
        The flip-flop has a single data input (d), a clock input (clk), and an output (q).
        
    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: clk, d
        Output: q (reg type because it will be set within an always block)

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed as the logic is straightforward and can be implemented directly within the always block.
        
    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        - Input: clk (used to trigger the data capture)
        - Input: d (data to be captured at the positive edge of clk)
        - Output: q (to hold the value captured from d, reg type because it's updated in an always block)
        
        Use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to implement the flip-flop logic:
        - Inside the always block, assign the value of d to q using a non-blocking assignment (<=).
        - This ensures that q captures and holds the value of d at each positive edge of clk.

Summary:
The module starts by declaring the inputs and the output. Since q is updated within an always block, it is declared as a reg type. An always block is used to capture the value of d at each positive edge of the clk, ensuring q updates correctly. Non-blocking assignments are used to avoid combinational feedback issues.
