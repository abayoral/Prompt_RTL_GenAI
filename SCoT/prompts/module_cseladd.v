Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The requirement is to magnify the implemented 16-bit adder to support handling 32-bit numbers.
        This would additionally require another module which is a 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer.
        The multiplexer should take two 16-bit inputs and a control signal to determine which input is passed to the output.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs for the adder: Two 32-bit numbers a, b
        Output for the adder: 32-bit sum.
        Inputs for the multiplexer: Two 16-bit numbers and a selection control signal
        Output for the multiplexer: The selected 16-bit number.

    Intermediate Signals:
         The carry signal from each of the 16-bit adders would be used as control signal for the multiplexer.

    Structuring the Module:
        We start with the declaration of the top_module.
        Three instances of 16-bit adder modules are instantiated to handle addition of 32 bit numbers.
        The outputs of the least significant 16 bits of the first two 32-bit numbers are added by the first 16-bit adder. 
        The most significant 16-bits of the input numbers are added by the second and third adders with the consideration of 
        carry generated by the first adder.
        This is where our multiplexer comes into play, 
        it chooses between the sums and carry outs of the second and third adders based on the carry out of the first adder.
        Then finally, the multiplexer's output is combined with the sum of the first adder to form a 32-bit sum output.
