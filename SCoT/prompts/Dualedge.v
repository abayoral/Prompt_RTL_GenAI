Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        We need to create a circuit that behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using only positive-edge and negative-edge triggered flip-flops as an FPGA does not support dual-edge triggered flip-flops.
        The dual-edge triggered flip-flop should capture the value of the data input (d) on both the rising and falling edges of the clock (clk), and maintain this value on the output (q).

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: clk, d
        Output: q

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        - We need two intermediate signals:
            - q_pos: to capture the value of d at the rising edge of clk.
            - q_neg: to capture the value of d at the falling edge of clk.
        - A final intermediate signal:
            - q_internal: to determine the actual output of q based on the current edge of the clock.

    Structuring the Module:
        - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        - Declare the intermediate signals: q_pos, q_neg, and q_internal.
        - Create two always blocks, one triggered on the rising edge of clk and another on the falling edge of clk.
            - Inside the first always block (triggered on the rising edge of clk), assign the value of d to q_pos.
            - Inside the second always block (triggered on the falling edge of clk), assign the value of d to q_neg.
        - Create one final always block, triggered on both edges of clk, to assign q_internal:
            - If the edge is positive (rising), assign q_pos to q_internal.
            - If the edge is negative (falling), assign q_neg to q_internal.
        - Use an assign statement to make q equal to q_internal.
