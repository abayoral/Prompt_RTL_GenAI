To design a D flip-flop with synchronous reset, the thought process would involve understanding the requirements, determining the inputs and outputs, and then structuring the module. Here's the structured thought process:

### Chain of Thought

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - A D flip-flop captures the value of the data input (d) at the rising edge of the clock (clk) and holds this value until the next rising edge.
    - The flip-flop has a synchronous reset (r), which means if r is asserted (high), the output (q) should be reset to 0 at the next rising edge of the clock.
    - If r is deasserted (low), the flip-flop should operate normally, capturing and holding the value of d on each rising edge of the clock.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: clk, d, r (synchronous reset)
    - Output: q

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are needed as the logic is straightforward and can be directly implemented using always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
    - Inside the always block:
        - Check the value of the synchronous reset (r).
        - If r is high (asserted), assign 0 to q.
        - If r is low (deasserted), assign the value of d to q on the rising edge of the clock.
    - Ensure that q holds the value assigned based on the above conditions.

This thought process ensures that the flip-flop captures the value of d only when the clock rises and resets to 0 synchronously based on the synchronous reset signal.
