Chain of Thought:

**Understand the Requirements:**
1. The counter is a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 through 15 (inclusive).
2. The period of the counting cycle is 16.
3. The reset input is synchronous, meaning the counter resets to 0 on the rising edge of the clock when the reset signal is active high.

**Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
1. **Inputs:** 
   - `clk` (clock signal, triggers the counting)
   - `reset` (synchronous reset signal, active-high)
2. **Output:** 
   - `q[3:0]` (4-bit output representing the current count)

**Define Intermediate Signals:**
1. No intermediate signals are needed since the logic is straightforward and can be implemented directly using standard Verilog constructs (always block and reset conditionals).

**Structuring the Module:**
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - Start by specifying the inputs (`clk`, `reset`) and the output (`q[3:0]`).

2. **Always block for synchronous logic:**
   - Use an `always` block that is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock.
   
3. **Reset Logic:**
   - Inside the always block, first check if the `reset` signal is high.
   - If `reset` is high, assign zero to `q` to reset the counter.

4. **Counting Logic:**
   - If `reset` is not high, increment the value of `q` on each rising edge of the clock.
   - Note that because `q` is a 4-bit value, it will naturally wrap around from 15 back to 0.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the module with the input and output declarations.

2. **Always Block for Clock Edge Detection:**
   - Implement an always block triggered by the positive edge of the `clk`.

3. **Check Reset Signal:**
   - Inside the always block, use an `if` conditional to check if the `reset` signal is high.
   - If `reset` is high, set the output `q` to 0.

4. **Increment Counter:**
   - If `reset` is not high, increment the counter `q`.

By following these steps, the 4-bit binary counter will correctly count from 0 to 15 and reset synchronously when the reset signal is activated.
