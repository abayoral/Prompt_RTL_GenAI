Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        Implement a 3-bit binary ripple-carry adder using instances of full adder.
        The adder will add two 3-bit input numbers (a, b) and a carry-in (cin).
        The outputs are a three 1-bit carry-out (cout[2:0]) for each full adder and a 3-bit sum (sum[2:0]).
        cout[2] signifies the final carry-out from the last full adder.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a[2:0], b[2:0], cin
        Outputs: cout[2:0], sum[2:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        Three instances of full-adder will be required.
        Each full-adder will have two 1-bit inputs, a 1-bit carry-in and outputs a 1-bit sum and a 1-bit carry-out.
        The full-adder instances can be linked in series, with the carry-out of one adder feeding into the carry-in of the next.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Instantiate three instances of Full Adder modules for adding the corresponding bits of a and b, passing carry-in and carry-out appropriately.
        
        Adder instance 1:
            Inputs: a[0], b[0], cin
            Outputs: sum[0], cout[0]

        Adder instance 2:
            Inputs: a[1], b[1], cout[0] (carry-in is carry-out from previous adder)
            Outputs: sum[1], cout[1]

        Adder instance 3:
            Inputs: a[2], b[2], cout[1] (carry-in is carry-out from previous adder)
            Outputs: sum[2], cout[2]
