To design the specified circuit that acts as an 8x1 memory with an 8-bit shift register and read access using multiplexers, let's break down the tasks into clear steps and provide our chain of thought:

### Chain of Thought:

#### 1. Understand the Requirements:
- **8-bit Shift Register**:
  - The shift register will have 8 D flip-flops.
  - Label the flip-flop outputs from Q\[0\] to Q\[7\]. 
  - The input for shifting in data (S) will feed into Q\[0\], and data will be shifted towards Q\[7\].
  - The register will shift bits on the rising edge of the clock (clk) if the enable signal is active.

- **Read access using Multiplexers**:
  - There are three additional inputs: A, B, C.
  - Output Z will be selected based on the 3-bit binary value ABC.
  - A 3-bit value ABC can represent binary values from 000 to 111, so we'll utilize an 8-to-1 multiplexer to select one of Q\[0\] to Q\[7\] accordingly.

- **3-Input Look-Up Table (LUT)**:
  - The LUT functionality can be implemented using an 8-to-1 multiplexer to select which bit (Q\[0\] to Q\[7\]) appears on the output Z.

#### 2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
  - **Inputs**:
    - clk (clock signal)
    - enable (shift enable signal)
    - S (shifted-in data)
    - A, B, C (3-bit selection inputs for multiplexer)
  - **Output**:
    - Z (multiplexer output, corresponds to one of Q\[0\] to Q\[7\])

#### 3. Define Intermediate Signals:
  - Q\[7:0\] (Outputs of the 8-bit shift register, intermediate signals)

#### 4. Structuring the Module:
  1. **Shift Register Block**:
     - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
     - Inside the block, check if the enable signal is high.
     - If yes, shift the value of the register to the right, inserting S at Q\[0\].

  2. **Multiplexer Block**:
     - Use a combinational block (such as case statement) to implement an 8-to-1 multiplexer.
     - Based on the binary value of ABC, assign the corresponding Q value to Z.
       - For example, if ABC is 000, assign Q\[0\] to Z.
       - If ABC is 001, assign Q\[1\] to Z, and so on up to ABC 111 which should select Q\[7\].

This structure ensures that the write operation into the memory is performed via shifting, and the read operation utilizes the 8-to-1 multiplexer to provide "random access" to the stored bits based on the selection inputs ABC.
