Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The FSM is tasked with controlling a shift register by enabling it (through the signal shift_ena) for exactly 4 clock cycles when the FSM is reset.
        After the shift_ena is asserted for 4 cycles, it should be deasserted and remain deasserted until the FSM is reset again.
        The inputs to the module are the clock (clk) and a synchronous reset signal (reset), and the output is the shift_ena signal.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: clk, reset
        Output: shift_ena

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        Define a counter to track the number of clock cycles for which shift_ena has been asserted.
        Define states for the FSM such as IDLE (when not in operation), ENABLE (asserting shift_ena), and DONE (when the shift_ena has already been asserted for 4 cycles).
    
    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Define the FSM states using parameters.
        Use a register to hold the current state.
        Define a counter register to track the number of clock cycles while in the ENABLE state.
        
        Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to implement the FSM logic:
            When reset is asserted:
                - Transition to the ENABLE state.
                - Initialize the counter to 0.
            When in the ENABLE state:
                - Assert shift_ena.
                - Increment the counter each clock cycle.
                - Transition to the DONE state after the counter reaches 4.
            When in the DONE state:
                - Deassert shift_ena and remain in DONE state.
            When in the IDLE state:
                - Remain in IDLE state when not reset.
                - Reset the counter and transition to ENABLE state when reset is asserted.

        Use an assign statement to output the shift_ena signal based on the state of the FSM.
