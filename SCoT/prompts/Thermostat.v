Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The thermostat controls a heater, an air conditioner, and a blower fan.
        It operates in two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0).
        When in heating mode, the heater is turned on if it is too cold (too_cold = 1).
        When in cooling mode, the air conditioner is turned on if it is too hot (too_hot = 1).
        Whenever the heater or air conditioner is on, the fan should also be on.
        There is an additional control input (fan_on) which can turn the fan on regardless of the heater or air conditioner state.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: too_cold, too_hot, mode, fan_on
        Outputs: heater, aircon, fan

    Define the Behavior:
        The heater should be on when the mode is heating and too_cold is 1; otherwise, the heater is off.
        The air conditioner should be on when the mode is cooling and too_hot is 1; otherwise, the air conditioner is off.
        The fan should be on if either the heater or air conditioner are on, or if the fan_on signal is high.

    Reverse Engineering from Outputs:
        To determine the states of the outputs, trace backwards to determine the required conditions based on inputs.
        
    Constructing the Logic in Natural Language:
        Heater Logic:
            The heater is on if mode is heating and it is too cold.
            Therefore, the heater output is the logical AND of mode and too_cold.
        Air Conditioner Logic:
            The air conditioner is on if mode is cooling and it is too hot.
            Therefore, the air conditioner output is the logical AND of NOT(mode) and too_hot.
        Fan Logic:
            The fan is on if either the heater or air conditioner are on, or if the fan_on signal is high.
            Therefore, the fan output is the logical OR of the heater output, the air conditioner output, and the fan_on input.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration including the inputs and outputs.
        For the heater output, use an assign statement to implement the conditions for the heater being on.
        For the air conditioner output, use an assign statement to implement the conditions for the air conditioner being on.
        For the fan output, use an assign statement to combine the conditions for the fan being on.

This structure ensures the proper control logic is in place for the heating/cooling thermostat based on the described requirements.
