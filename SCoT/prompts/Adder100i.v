Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need to design a 100-bit ripple-carry adder.
    - The adder will add two 100-bit binary numbers `a` and `b` and a carry-in `cin`.
    - The output should be a 100-bit sum `sum` and an array of carry-out signals `cout`.
    - Each full adder instance will produce an individual carry-out, which should be connected in a ripple-carry fashion.
    - `cout[99]` will be the final carry-out signal from the adder chain.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `a[99:0]` (first 100-bit number), `b[99:0]` (second 100-bit number), `cin` (initial carry-in).
    - Outputs: `sum[99:0]` (100-bit sum), `cout[99:0]` (individual carry-out signals from each full adder).

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - Each full adder will need to pass its carry-out to the next full adder's carry-in.
    - Create an array of carry signals to represent the internal connections between the full adders.

4. **Modular Full Adder Design**:
    - Design a single-bit full adder module that takes two single bits, a carry-in, and produces a sum and carry-out.

5. **Structuring the Top Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Declare any necessary intermediate signals.
    - Use a `generate` statement to instantiate 100 full adders in a loop.

6. **Connecting Full Adders**:
    - The carry-out of each full adder instance will connect to the carry-in of the next full adder instance.
    - The first full adder's carry-in will be connected to `cin`.
    - The sum and carry-out of each full adder should be assigned to the respective output arrays.

7. **Pseudocode Structure**:
    - Create a submodule for the single-bit full adder with inputs for two bits, carry-in, and outputs for sum and carry-out.
    - Instantiate the 100 full adder instances within a generate loop.
    - Connect the carry-out of each instance to the carry-in of the next instance.
    - Ensure all outputs are correctly assigned.

8. **Additional Information**:
    - Handle the initialization and connection carefully to avoid any misalignment in the 100-bit addition.
    - Propagate carries properly across the chain of full adders to ensure the cumulative sum is accurate.

By following these steps, we can ensure the accurate construction and functionality of the 100-bit ripple-carry adder with the required outputs.
