### Understand the Requirements:
1. **`out_both`**: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'. The `out_both` vector has 99 bits since `in[99]` has no left neighbour to consider.
   - Example: `out_both[98]` should reflect if both `in[98]` and `in[99]` are '1'.
2. **`out_any`**: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. The `out_any` vector has 99 bits since `in[0]` has no right neighbour to consider.
   - Example: `out_any[2]` should reflect if either `in[2]` or `in[1]` are '1'.
3. **`out_different`**: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. In this case, treat the vector as wrapping around, so `in[99]`â€™s left neighbour is `in[0]`.
   - Example: `out_different[98]` should reflect if `in[98]` is different from `in[99]`.

### Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `in` (100-bit vector)
2. **Outputs**:
   - `out_both` (99-bit vector)
   - `out_any` (99-bit vector starting from index 1)
   - `out_different` (100-bit vector)

### Define Intermediate Signals:
- No intermediate signals are strictly needed since the relationships can be directly mapped from the input signals using vector operations.

### Structuring the Module:
1. **Module Declaration**:
   - Specify the inputs and outputs in the module declaration.

2. **Implementing the Logic**:
   - **out_both**: Perform a bitwise AND between `in[98:0]` and `in[99:1]` since these ranges cover the pairs where both needs to be checked.
   - **out_any**: Perform a bitwise OR between `in[99:1]` and `in[98:0]` since these ranges cover the pairs where any needs to be checked.
   - **out_different**: Perform a bitwise XOR between `in` and a left-circularly shifted version of `in` to account for the wrapping around for bit 99.

### Summarized Structure:
- **Module Declaration**: Inputs and Outputs Declaration
- **Assign Statements**:
  - Use assign statements to implement the required operations for `out_both`, `out_any`, and `out_different`, leveraging bitwise operations and slices of the input vector.

By defining the module with clear input-output specifications and implementing the described logic concisely in assign statements, we can effectively achieve the desired functionality in a straightforward manner.
