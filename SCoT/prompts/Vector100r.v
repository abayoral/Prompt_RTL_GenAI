Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to reverse the bit ordering of a 100-bit input vector. This means that in[0] becomes out[99], in[1] becomes out[98], and so forth.
    - The task should be done using a combinational logic block without needing to instantiate other modules.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: a 100-bit vector `in`.
    - Outputs: a 100-bit vector `out`.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are required for this problem as the input can be directly mapped to the output in a reversed order.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use a combinational always block to describe the logic for reversing the bits.

5. **Logic to Reverse the Bits:**
    - Utilize a for loop within a combinational always block to assign values from `in` to `out` in reverse order.
    - The loop should iterate 100 times, and for each iteration, assign the bit from `in` at the current index to the corresponding reversed index in `out`.

6. **Ensure the Correct Usage of Combinational Logic:**
    - An always @* block will be used to ensure that the logic is combinational.

7. **Summarize the General Steps in Pseudocode:**
    - Declare the module with the input and output.
    - Use an always block with a for loop to reverse the bits:
        - The loop index runs from 0 to 99.
        - For each index, assign out[99 - index] = in[index].

This structured approach ensures that we accomplish the task efficiently using combinational logic.
