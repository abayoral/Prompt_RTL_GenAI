Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A population count (also known as a Hamming weight or bit count) circuit counts the number of 1s in an input vector.
        The given input vector is 255 bits wide.
        The output should be an 8-bit number representing the count of 1s in the input vector.
        
    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Input: 255-bit vector (in)
        Output: 8-bit count of 1s (out)

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        We will need an intermediate signal to store the cumulative count of 1s as we iterate through the input vector.
        Another intermediate signal to incrementally count 1s in the input vector during iteration.

    Consider Algorithm Implementation:
        A loop is an efficient way to iterate through all 255 bits of the input vector.
        Use a for loop to iterate over each bit of the input vector.
        Inside the loop, check if the current bit is 1.
        Increment the intermediate count signal if the current bit is 1.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Declare the intermediate signal to hold the cumulative count.
        Initialize the intermediate count signal to zero.
        Use a for loop to iterate over each bit of the input vector.
        For each bit, check if it is 1, and if so, increment the intermediate count signal.
        After the loop, assign the final value of the intermediate count signal to the output signal (out).
