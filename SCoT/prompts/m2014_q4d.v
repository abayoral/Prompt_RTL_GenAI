Chain of Thought:

Understand the Requirements:
- A D flip-flop captures the value of the data input (in) at the rising edge of the clock (clk) and holds this value until the next rising edge.
- The module has one data input (in), one clock input (clk), and one output (out).

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- Inputs: clk, in
- Output: out

Define Intermediate Signals:
- No intermediate signals are needed as the flip-flop implementation is straightforward.

Structuring the Module:
- Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs (clk, in) and output (out).
- Use an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
- Inside the always block, assign the value of the input signal (in) to the output signal (out) on each rising edge of the clock.
- This ensures that out captures and holds the value of in at the time of the clock's rising edge.
