Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        We need to create a combinational circuit with 100 inputs and three specific outputs.
        The outputs should reflect the results of applying three different bitwise reduction operations on the 100 inputs:
            - out_and: The result of a 100-input AND operation.
            - out_or: The result of a 100-input OR operation.
            - out_xor: The result of a 100-input XOR operation.
        Inputs: in[99:0]
        Outputs: out_and, out_or, out_xor
        Reduction operators can be used to simplify the implementation of these operations.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Input: in[99:0] - This is a 100-bit wide input.
        Outputs: 
            out_and - Result of ANDing all 100 input bits.
            out_or - Result of ORing all 100 input bits.
            out_xor - Result of XORing all 100 input bits.

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed because the reduction operators will be directly applied to the inputs.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use assign statements to define each output by applying the corresponding reduction operator on the 100-bit input.
        - The reduction AND operator (&) can be used to compute out_and.
        - The reduction OR operator (|) can be used to compute out_or.
        - The reduction XOR operator (^) can be used to compute out_xor.
     
    Formulate the Logic:
        For out_and, use the `&` reduction operator on all bits of input.
        For out_or, use the `|` reduction operator on all bits of input.
        For out_xor, use the `^` reduction operator on all bits of input.

This approach ensures that the output calculations are performed efficiently using built-in reduction operators, leading to a succinct and clear implementation of the required combinational circuit.
