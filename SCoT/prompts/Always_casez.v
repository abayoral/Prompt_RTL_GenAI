Task: Build a priority encoder for 8-bit inputs.

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - A priority encoder takes an 8-bit input vector and outputs the position of the first (least significant) bit that is high (1).
    - If no bits are high, the output should be zero.
    - The output should be a 3-bit value representing the position of the first high bit.
    - Example: For input `8'b10010000`, the output should be `3'd4` because bit 4 is the first high bit.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Input: `in[7:0]` (8-bit input vector)
    - Output: `pos[2:0]` (3-bit position of the first high bit)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No intermediate signals are needed for this implementation.
    - The output signal can be updated directly by checking each bit of the input vector sequentially.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - **Start with the module declaration**, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - **Use an always block** to determine the position of the first high bit.
    - **Inside the always block**, use if-else or case statements to check each bit of `in`, starting from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.
    - If a bit is found to be high, assign the corresponding position value to `pos`.
    - **If none of the bits are high**, ensure that `pos` is set to zero.
    - **Ensure appropriate sensitivity list** for the always block to react to changes in the input vector.

Summary of the actions in natural language:
    - Initialize the module with input and output declarations.
    - Inside an always block, sequentially check each bit of the input vector starting from the least significant bit.
    - If a bit is found to be high, set the output to the position of that bit.
    - If no bits are high, set the output to zero.
    - Use conditional statements to determine which bit is the first high bit and update the output accordingly.
