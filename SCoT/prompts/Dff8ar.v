## Chain of Thought:

### Understand the Requirements:
1. Create an array of 8 D flip-flops.
2. Each D flip-flop has an active high asynchronous reset.
3. All flip-flops are triggered by the positive edge of the clock (clk).
4. The asynchronous reset (areset) will immediately set the output to a defined value (usually zero) regardless of the clock.
5. Each flip-flop will have a data input (D) and an output (Q). 
6. Since we need 8 D flip-flops, the inputs (D) and outputs (Q) will be vectors of 8 bits.

### Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock signal
  - `areset`: Active high asynchronous reset
  - `d[7:0]`: 8-bit data input
  
- **Outputs:**
  - `q[7:0]`: 8-bit data output
  
### Define Intermediate Signals:
- No intermediate signals are needed as each flip-flop directly maps the input to the output.

### Structuring the Module:
1. Start with the module declaration specifying the inputs and outputs.
2. Define an always block sensitive to the asynchronous reset and the positive edge of the clock.
3. Inside the always block:
   - Use a conditional statement to check if the asynchronous reset is high.
   - If the asynchronous reset is high, set the output (Q) to zero.
   - If the asynchronous reset is not high, on the positive edge of the clock, assign the input (D) to the output (Q).

### Detailed Pseudocode Steps:
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - Specify the module name: `top_module`
   - List the inputs: `clk`, `areset`, `d[7:0]`
   - List the output: `q[7:0]`

2. **Always Block Configuration:**
   - Create an always block that is triggered by changes in the `areset` signal or the rising edge of `clk`.
   - Within the always block, include an if-else statement:
     - If `areset` is asserted (active high), set all bits of `q` to `0`.
     - Else, assign the value of `d` to `q` at the rising edge of `clk`.

### Conclusion:
The design will ensure that the 8-bit D flip-flops correctly follow the active high asynchronous reset behavior, and capture the input `d` on every positive clock edge.
