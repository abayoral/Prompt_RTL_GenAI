Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need to connect the ports of an instance of `mod_a` to the ports of a top-level module called `top_module`.
    - `mod_a` has two outputs and four inputs, specified in that order.
    - The `top_module` has corresponding ports named `out1`, `out2`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - `mod_a` Ports: 
        - Outputs: two unnamed outputs
        - Inputs: four unnamed inputs
    - `top_module` Ports: 
        - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`
        - Outputs: `out1`, `out2`

3. **Mapping Connections**:
    - `mod_a`'s 1st output connects to `top_module`'s `out1`.
    - `mod_a`'s 2nd output connects to `top_module`'s `out2`.
    - `mod_a`'s 1st input connects to `top_module`'s `a`.
    - `mod_a`'s 2nd input connects to `top_module`'s `b`.
    - `mod_a`'s 3rd input connects to `top_module`'s `c`.
    - `mod_a`'s 4th input connects to `top_module`'s `d`.

4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration of `top_module`, specifying all the required inputs and outputs.
    - Declare an instance of `mod_a` within `top_module`.
    - Connect the instance ports of `mod_a` by their position to the appropriate ports of `top_module`.
    - Place the output ports first, followed by the input ports, while maintaining their respective positions.

5. **Implementation Strategy**:
    - Inside the `top_module`, instantiate `mod_a`, and map its ports with the corresponding ports of `top_module` using ordered connections.

By following these steps, the design will remain organized, maintain clarity, and ensure the correct signal mapping across module boundaries.
