Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        We need to design a Moore state machine for a water reservoir controller with three water level sensors (S_1, S_2, S_3) and four output signals (FR1, FR2, FR3, delta FR).
        Outputs depend on the water level sensed by the three sensors and changes to the flow rate based on the previous water levels.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: clk, reset, s[3:1] (representing S_1, S_2, S_3)
        Outputs: fr3, fr2, fr1, dfr

    Define the States:
        Define states based on water level and corresponding sensor inputs:
        State 1: "Below S_1" (none of S_1, S_2, S_3 are asserted)
        State 2: "Between S_2 and S_1" (only S_1 is asserted)
        State 3: "Between S_3 and S_2" (S_1 and S_2 are asserted, but not S_3)
        State 4: "Above S_3" (S_1, S_2, and S_3 are all asserted)
        Use the reset state to initialize to "Below S_1" level.

    Determine State Transitions and Outputs:
        State Transitions:
            From State 1 to State 2 when S_1 becomes asserted.
            From State 2 to State 3 when S_2 becomes asserted.
            From State 3 to State 4 when S_3 becomes asserted.
            From State 4 to State 3 when S_3 becomes de-asserted.
            From State 3 to State 2 when S_2 becomes de-asserted.
            From State 2 to State 1 when S_1 becomes de-asserted.
        
        Outputs for Each State:
            State 1 ("Below S_1"): fr1, fr2, fr3 asserted, delta FR = 1
            State 2 ("Between S_2 and S_1"): fr1, fr2 asserted, delta FR depends on previous higher state
            State 3 ("Between S_3 and S_2"): fr1 asserted, delta FR depends on previous higher state
            State 4 ("Above S_3"): no flow rate, delta FR = 0

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Define state registers and state encoding.
        Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock or on reset to manage state transitions.
        Inside the always block, implement the state transition logic based on sensor inputs.
        Use another always block to define output logic for each state.
        Ensure proper handling of the synchronous reset to force the state machine back to the "Below S_1" state with all flow rates asserted.

    Additional Considerations:
        The implementation must track the previous water level state to correctly manage the delta FR output when the water level decreases. This might require an additional register to store the previous state.
        Ensure the FSM handles edge cases properly, such as multiple sensor changes within a single clock cycle, by prioritizing the most critical changes (e.g., from State 1 directly to State 4).

This thought process ensures a clear design flow and addresses all requirements before writing any Verilog code.
