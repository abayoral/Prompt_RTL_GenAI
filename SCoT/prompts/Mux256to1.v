Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
    - A 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer is required.
    - The multiplexer takes a 256-bit input vector (`in`) and a 8-bit select signal (`sel`).
    - The output (`out`) should reflect the bit in the input vector `in` as pointed to by the select signal `sel`.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
    - Input: A 256-bit vector (`in`)
    - Input: An 8-bit selection signal (`sel`)
    - Output: A single bit (`out`)

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
    - No intermediate signals are necessary since this task can be achieved directly using the selection capability of the language.

4. Structuring the Module:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Instead of using a case statement (which would be cumbersome for 256 cases), use the vector indexing capability of Verilog.
    - Assign the output (`out`) using the `in` vector indexed by the select signal `sel`.
    - This approach allows the synthesizer to deduce that we're selecting a constant-width item (1 bit) out of the input vector.

By following these steps, you can clearly outline how the 256-to-1 multiplexer will be implemented using variable indexing directly on the input vector. This method leverages the feature of Verilog that allows dynamic indexing of vectors to achieve the desired functionality efficiently.
