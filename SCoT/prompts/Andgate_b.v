Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        An AND gate outputs a high signal (1) only if both inputs are high (1). Otherwise, it outputs a low signal (0).
        For an AND gate, we have two inputs (a and b) and one output (out).

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a, b
        Output: out

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed because the logic is straightforward and can be implemented directly.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use an assign statement to define the output (out).
        Use the bitwise AND operator (&) to perform the AND operation between inputs a and b. The bitwise AND operator is appropriate here since we are dealing with single-bit inputs.
        Assign the result of the AND operation to the output (out).
