1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - A simple circuit where an input signal (`in`) connects to an output signal (`out`).
   - This appears to be a direct wire connection.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Inputs:** `in`
   - **Outputs:** `out`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - In this case, there are no intermediate signals needed because the input directly connects to the output without any modification or logic.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the input (`in`) and the output (`out`).
   - Internally, connect the input signal directly to the output signal.
   
5. **Pseudocode Steps:**
   - Begin with the module declaration.
   - Specify that `in` is an input and `out` is an output.
   - Use an assignment operation to connect `in` to `out`, indicating a direct wire connection.
