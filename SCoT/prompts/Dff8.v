Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The task is to create 8 D flip-flops. Each D flip-flop captures the value of its respective data input (d) at the rising edge of the clock (clk) and holds this value until the next rising edge.
        The D flip-flops are independent but share the same clock (clk).
        Each flip-flop has an input from a different bit of a shared 8-bit input vector (d[7:0]), and outputs to an 8-bit output vector (q[7:0]).

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: clk (shared clock signal for all flip-flops), d[7:0] (8-bit input vector)
        Output: q[7:0] (8-bit output vector)

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed as we are directly connecting the inputs and outputs to the appropriate flip-flop logic.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use a generate statement or instantiate 8 separate always blocks to create each of the 8 D flip-flops.
        For each D flip-flop, use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
        Inside each always block, assign the respective bit of the input vector (d) to the corresponding bit of the output vector (q).
        Ensure that each bit of the input vector (d) is independently captured into the corresponding bit of the output vector (q) on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
