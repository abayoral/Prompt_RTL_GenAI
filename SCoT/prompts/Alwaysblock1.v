Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - Implement an AND gate using both `assign` and `always` combinational blocks.
   - The module has two inputs (`a` and `b`) and produces two outputs (`out_assign` and `out_alwaysblock`).
   - The `assign` statement will be used to drive `out_assign`.
   - The combinational `always` block will be used to drive `out_alwaysblock`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Inputs: `a`, `b`
   - Outputs: `out_assign`, `out_alwaysblock`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - In this case, no additional intermediate signals are needed as the logic is direct and simple.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
   - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
   - Use an `assign` statement to drive `out_assign`.
     - The `assign` statement connects the logical AND of `a` and `b` to `out_assign`.
   - Use an `always` block to drive `out_alwaysblock`.
     - The `always` block should be sensitive to changes in `a` or `b`.
     - Inside the `always` block, assign the logical AND of `a` and `b` to `out_alwaysblock`.

In summary, the solution involves two sections:
1. Using an `assign` statement to directly assign the AND result to `out_assign`.
2. Using a combinational `always` block sensitive to `a` and `b` to assign the AND result to `out_alwaysblock`.
