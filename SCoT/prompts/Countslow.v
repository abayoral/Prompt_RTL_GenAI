Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
  - A decade counter that counts from 0 through 9.
  - A reset input that synchronously resets the counter to 0.
  - A control signal (slowena) that determines if the counter should increment on a clock cycle.
  - Inputs: clk (clock signal), slowena (control signal), reset (reset signal).
  - Outputs: q[3:0] (4-bit output representing the counter value, since counting from 0 to 9 requires 4 bits).

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
  - Inputs: `clk`, `slowena`, `reset`.
  - Output: `q[3:0]`.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
  - No intermediate signals are necessary since the counter logic can be directly implemented inside the always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
  - **Module Declaration:**
    - Specify the input and output ports.
  
  - **Always Block:**
    - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal to define synchronous operations.
    - Inside the always block:
      - If the reset signal is high, set the output `q` to 0.
      - Otherwise, if the slowena signal is high, increment the counter value in `q`.
      - Ensure the counter wraps around to 0 after reaching 9 to maintain the decade count.

5. **Detailed Steps:**
  - Declare the module and specify inputs and outputs.
  - Implement an always block sensitive to the rising edge of the clock signal.
  - Inside the always block:
    - First, handle the reset condition: if `reset` is high, assign 0 to `q`.
    - If `reset` is not high and `slowena` is high,:
      - Check if the current value of `q` is less than 9.
      - If yes, increment `q` by 1.
      - If no, wrap `q` back to 0 (to maintain the decade count from 0 to 9).
    - If `slowena` is low, do nothing (maintain the current value of `q`).

By carefully following the above thought process, the design ensures that the counter operates correctly, incrementing only when enabled, and resetting or wrapping around as needed.
