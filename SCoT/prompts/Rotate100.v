Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A 100-bit rotator shifts the bits either to the left or to the right, wrapping the shifted-out bit to the opposite end. It does not discard any bits.
        The rotator has a load input to synchronously load the shift register with a new 100-bit value.
        It has a control signal (ena) to determine the direction of rotation or to disable rotation.
        Based on the value of ena:
            2'b01: Rotate right by one bit.
            2'b10: Rotate left by one bit.
            2'b00 or 2'b11: No rotation.
        The contents of the rotator are output through q.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: clk, load, ena[1:0], data[99:0]
        Output: q[99:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are specifically required because the logic can be derived directly within the always block.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to implement the synchronous load and rotation logic.
        Inside the always block:
            If the load signal is high, load the data[99:0] into q[99:0].
            If load is low, check the value of ena to determine the rotation direction:
                If ena is 2'b01, perform a right rotation:
                    The last bit of q (q[99]) should be moved to the first position (q[0]).
                    All other bits should be shifted to the right by one position.
                If ena is 2'b10, perform a left rotation:
                    The first bit of q (q[0]) should be moved to the last position (q[99]).
                    All other bits should be shifted to the left by one position.
                If ena is 2'b00 or 2'b11, no rotation takes place and q remains unchanged.
