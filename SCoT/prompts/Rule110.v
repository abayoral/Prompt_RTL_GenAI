Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - Implement Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular automaton, in hardware.
    - The system should consist of a 512-cell array, updated every clock cycle.
    - The `load` input initializes the system with the provided state `data[511:0]`.
    - The next state of each cell depends on its own state and the state of its two neighbors, according to Rule 110.
    - Boundaries are assumed to be zero (off).

2. **Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `load` (load signal), `data[511:0]` (initial state data).
    - Output: `q[511:0]` (current state of the 512-cell array).

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - An intermediate array `next_q[511:0]` to hold the next state of each cell before updating `q`.
    - It is necessary to calculate the next state for all cells based on the current state before updating `q`.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock or when the load signal is active.
    - Inside the always block:
        - If the load signal is high, assign `data` to `q` to initialize the system state.
        - Otherwise, for each cell in the range [0-511]:
            - Determine the states of the left neighbor, the current cell, and the right neighbor. For the boundary cases:
                - Left neighbor of the first cell (index 0) is off (0).
                - Right neighbor of the last cell (index 511) is off (0).
            - Implement the Rule 110 logic to calculate the next state:
                - Use conditional statements (if-else or case) to determine the next state based on the left, center, and right neighbor states.
        - Finally, update `q` with `next_q`.
