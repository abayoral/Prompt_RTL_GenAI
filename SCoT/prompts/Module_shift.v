Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - We need to create a 3-stage shift register using three instances of the provided `my_dff` module.
    - Each D flip-flop captures the value on its data input (`d`) at the rising edge of the clock (`clk`) and drives this value to its output (`q`).
    - The output of each D flip-flop should be connected to the data input of the next flip-flop in the sequence.
    - The `clk` signal needs to be connected to all three D flip-flops.
    
2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Input: `clk` (clock signal), `d` (data input)
    - Output: `q` (output of the last D flip-flop in the chain)
    
3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - We need two intermediate signals to connect the outputs of the first and second flip-flops to the inputs of the subsequent flip-flops.
        - `q1`: Output of the first D flip-flop
        - `q2`: Output of the second D flip-flop
    
4. **Structuring the Module**:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Instantiate three instances of the `my_dff` module.
        - The first instance should have its data input (`d`) connected to the module input `d`, and its output connected to the intermediate signal `q1`.
        - The second instance should have its data input connected to `q1`, and its output connected to the intermediate signal `q2`.
        - The third instance should have its data input connected to `q2`, and its output connected to the module output `q`.
        - All three instances should have their `clk` ports connected to the module input `clk`.
