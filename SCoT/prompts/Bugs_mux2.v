Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - A 2-to-1 multiplexer selects one of two 8-bit inputs based on a control signal (`sel`) and outputs the selected input.
    - The multiplexer has two 8-bit data inputs `a`, `b`, and one control signal `sel`.
    - If `sel` is high (`1`), the output should be the value of `b`.
    - If `sel` is low (`0`), the output should be the value of `a`.
    - The output is an 8-bit vector, not a single bit.

2. **Identify the Bug**:
    - The output `out` is defined as a scalar while it should be an 8-bit vector.
    - The logic expression `(~sel & a) | (sel & b)` is correct but needs to be directed towards an 8-bit output.

3. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `sel`, `a` (8-bit), `b` (8-bit)
    - Output: `out` (8-bit)

4. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - No additional intermediate signals are needed since the selection logic is directly implemented in the assign statement.

5. **Structuring the Fix**:
    - Start with the module declaration, ensuring the inputs and outputs are properly specified.
    - Specifically, ensure `out` is declared as an 8-bit output instead of a single-bit scalar.
    - Use an assign statement to define the output `out`.
    - The assign statement uses a conditional operation involving `sel` to set each bit of `out` based on the corresponding bits of `a` and `b`.
