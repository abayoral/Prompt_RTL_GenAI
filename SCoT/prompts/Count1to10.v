Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10, inclusive.
    - When the counter reaches 10 and a clock pulse occurs, it should reset to 1.
    - The reset input is synchronous, meaning the counter should reset to 1 on the next rising edge of the clock if reset is high.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `clk`, `reset`
    - Output: `q[3:0]` (this 4-bit output will hold the current value of the counter)

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - In this case, no intermediate signals are necessary because the logic can be managed within the always block.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - **Module Declaration:**
        - Begin by specifying the inputs and outputs as provided.
    
    - **Always Block:**
        - The counter logic should be placed inside an always block triggered by the rising edge of the clock.
        
    - **Reset Logic:**
        - Inside the always block, check the reset signal.
        - If the reset signal is high, assign the value of 1 to `q` to reset the counter.

    - **Counter Logic:**
        - If the reset signal is low, check the current value of `q`.
        - If `q` is 10 (end of the decade count), assign `q` to 1 to loop the counter back to the beginning.
        - Otherwise, increment the value of `q` by 1 with each clock pulse.

This logical flow ensures that the decade counter counts from 1 to 10 inclusively, and resets appropriately based on the synchronous reset signal.
