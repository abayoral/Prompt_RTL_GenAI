Sure, let's break down the process to design a combinational circuit that splits a 16-bit input into its lower and upper bytes. 

### Understand the Requirements:
- We need to split a 16-bit input (`in`) into two 8-bit outputs: one representing the upper byte (`out_hi`) and one representing the lower byte (`out_lo`).

### Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input:** A 16-bit input, `in[15:0]`
- **Outputs:** Two 8-bit outputs, `out_hi[7:0]` and `out_lo[7:0]`

### Define Intermediate Signals:
- No intermediate signals are needed since the splitting can be done directly by indexing the desired bits from the input.

### Structuring the Module:
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - Declare the module with the specified inputs and outputs.

2. **Assign Statements:**
   - Use assign statements to split the input vector into the upper and lower bytes:
     - `out_hi` should be assigned the upper 8 bits of the input (`in[15:8]`).
     - `out_lo` should be assigned the lower 8 bits of the input (`in[7:0]`).

### Detailed Steps in Natural Language:
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - Start by declaring the module and specifying the input and output ports.

2. **Assign the Upper Byte:**
   - Extract bits 15 to 8 from the input and assign them to the `out_hi` output. This represents the upper byte.

3. **Assign the Lower Byte:**
   - Extract bits 7 to 0 from the input and assign them to the `out_lo` output. This represents the lower byte.

By following these steps, the bit slicing necessary for splitting the input into its upper and lower parts can be achieved efficiently and in a straightforward manner. This design does not require any intermediate signals as the operations are directly applied to the input bits and assigned to the corresponding outputs.
