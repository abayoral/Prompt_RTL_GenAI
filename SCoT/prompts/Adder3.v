Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        We need to create a 3-bit binary ripple-carry adder using three separate instances of a full-adder.
        The ripple-carry adder will add two 3-bit numbers, 'a' and 'b', along with an initial carry-in 'cin'.
        The outputs include a 3-bit sum and individual carry-out signals from each full-adder.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a[2:0], b[2:0], cin
        Outputs: sum[2:0], cout[2:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        Intermediate signals will be the carry-outs from each full-adder instance, labeled cout[1:0].

    Understand the Full-Adder Module:
        A full-adder takes three inputs (two bits and a carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.

    Structuring the Ripple-Carry Adder Module:
        Start with the module declaration for the ripple-carry adder, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Create intermediate signals to connect the carry-out of one full-adder to the carry-in of the next.
        
        Instantiate three full-adder modules inside the ripple-carry adder:
            1. The first full-adder takes 'a[0]', 'b[0]', and 'cin' as inputs, and outputs 'sum[0]' and 'cout[0]'.
            2. The second full-adder takes 'a[1]', 'b[1]', and 'cout[0]' as inputs, and outputs 'sum[1]' and 'cout[1]'.
            3. The third full-adder takes 'a[2]', 'b[2]', and 'cout[1]' as inputs, and outputs 'sum[2]' and 'cout[2]'.

    Steps:
        1. Declare the ripple-carry adder module and specify its inputs and outputs.
        2. Define intermediate signals for the carry-out connections.
        3. Instantiate three full-adder modules, connecting their inputs and outputs appropriately.
        4. For each full-adder instance, wire the inputs and outputs based on the bit position and carry connections.
        5. Ensure the final carry-out from the last full-adder is presented in the output 'cout[2]'.

This structured approach ensures the ripple-carry adder correctly sums the 3-bit inputs while propagating the carry across the full-adders.
