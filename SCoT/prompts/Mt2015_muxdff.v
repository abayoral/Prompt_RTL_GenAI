Before developing the hierarchical Verilog code for the sequential circuit, it's important to outline the requirements and design steps:

### Understanding the Requirements:
1. **Top-Level Module (`top_module`)**:
   - Contains a flip-flop and a multiplexer.
   - It should have four inputs: `clk` (clock), `L` (load/control signal), `r_in` (one of the data inputs to the multiplexer), and `q_in` (another data input to the multiplexer).
   - It outputs a single signal `Q` (the output of the flip-flop).

2. **Hierarchical Design**:
   - The main module should instantiate the `top_module` three times to create a more complex sequential circuit.

### Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
1. For `top_module`:
   - Inputs: `clk`, `L`, `r_in`, `q_in`
   - Output: `Q`

### Define Intermediate Signals:
1. **Multiplexer Output**:
   - An intermediate signal to hold the output of the multiplexer before feeding it to the flip-flop.
  
### Structuring `top_module`:
1. **Multiplexer Logic**:
   - A simple 2-to-1 multiplexer selects either `r_in` or `q_in` based on the control signal `L`.
2. **Flip-Flop Logic**:
   - A D flip-flop to capture the value of the multiplexer output on the rising edge of the clock.

### Hierarchical Design:
1. **Instantiation of `top_module`**:
   - Create an outer module to instantiate three `top_module` instances.
   - Correctly manage the interconnections between these instances.

### Chain of Thought for `top_module`:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
    - Needs to handle a clock input.
    - Incorporate a multiplexer to select between `r_in` and `q_in`.
    - Feed the output of the multiplexer to a flip-flop.
    - Output the state of the flip-flop.

2. **Determine Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Inputs: `clk`, `L`, `r_in`, `q_in`
    - Output: `Q`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals**:
    - An intermediate signal for the multiplexer output before it's fed to the flip-flop.

4. **Multiplexer Logic**:
    - Use a conditional operator to select between `r_in` and `q_in` based on `L`.

5. **Flip-Flop Logic**:
    - Utilize an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
    - Assign the value from the multiplexer output to `Q`.

### Structuring the Details:

1. **Module Declaration**:
    - Define the module with the above-specified inputs and output.
  
2. **Multiplexer Implementation**:
    - The assign statement inside combinational logic to define the multiplexer output.

3. **Flip-Flop Implementation**:
    - Use always block with posedge of the clock.
    - Assign the multiplexer output to `Q`.

By clearly understanding the requirements and systematically breaking down each step, the design process becomes manageable and coherent. The next steps would be to implement a module that instantiates `top_module` multiple times, interconnecting them as needed.
