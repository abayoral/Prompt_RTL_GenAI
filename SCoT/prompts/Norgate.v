Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A NOR gate is a digital logic gate that outputs 0 if at least one of its inputs is 1; otherwise, it outputs 1.
        The NOR function can be implemented by first performing an OR operation on the inputs and then inverting the result.
        Since we are dealing with a one-bit input, we can use either the bitwise-OR or the logical-OR operator to perform the OR operation.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a, b
        Output: out

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        An intermediate signal is not strictly necessary as the logic is straightforward. However, using one might improve readability.
        One intermediate signal can be defined for the OR operation result.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use an assign statement to define the intermediate signal that holds the result of the OR operation.
        Perform the OR operation on the inputs a and b.
        Invert the result of the OR operation and assign it to the output (out).
        This implementation ensures the correct behavior of the NOR gate.
