Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A combinational circuit with two inputs, a and b and seven outputs based on different logic operations.
        out_and: AND operation between a and b
        out_or: OR operation between a and b
        out_xor: XOR operation between a and b
        out_nand: NAND operation between a and b
        out_nor: NOR operation between a and b
        out_xnor: XNOR operation between a and b
        out_anotb: AND_NOT operation between a and b (AND operation between a and not(b))

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a, b
        Outputs: out_and, out_or, out_xor, out_nand, out_nor, out_xnor, out_anotb

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed in this scenario.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use assign statements to run the logic operations on a and b. All the logic operations are basic and do not require additional operations.
        The Statements should follow this form: 
        
        - output = a operation b
        - where operation represents the logic operations needed (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, AND_NOT)
        - For the last operation (out_anotb), it's essentially an AND operation between a and the NOT of b.
