Task: Generate a Verilog module for 8 D flip-flops with active high synchronous reset. The flip-flops must be reset to 0x34 rather than zero. All D flip-flops should be triggered by the negative edge of the clock (clk).

Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - A set of 8 D flip-flops (FFs) is required.
    - Each FF captures its data input (d) on the negative edge of the clock (clk).
    - There's an active high synchronous reset signal (reset).
    - When the reset is high, the output of each FF should reset to 0x34 instead of zero.
    - If the reset is low, the FF should capture the input data (d) at the negative edge of clk.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: clk, reset, d[7:0]
    - Outputs: q[7:0]

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are needed since the requirement specifies simple flip-flop behavior with a preset.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an always block triggered on the negative edge of the clock.
    - Inside the always block, use if-else statements to handle the active high synchronous reset and the regular data capturing.
    - If reset is high, assign q to the specific preset value of 0x34.
    - If reset is low, assign q the value captured from d on the negative edge of clk.

The thought process can be summarized as follows:
    - Declare a module with the required inputs (clk, reset, d) and outputs (q).
    - Use an always block triggered on the negative edge of clk.
    - Inside the always block, check if reset is high:
        - If reset is high, set q to the value 0x34.
        - If reset is low, set q to the value of d.
    - Ensure each of the 8 flip-flops operates correctly by iterating or handling individually if required.

By following this structured thought process, a Hardware Designer can clearly outline the steps and logic needed to create a Verilog module for 8 D flip-flops with specified reset behavior and clock edge triggering.
