Understanding the requirements of this task is crucial, so let's break it down step-by-step.

### Understand the Requirements:
1. **Karnaugh Map and Minimization:**
    - We need to implement the logic function derived from the given Karnaugh map using a 4-to-1 multiplexer and potentially some additional 2-to-1 multiplexers. 
    - Ensure to use `a` and `b` as the select lines for the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

2. **Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs to the module: `c`, `d`
    - Outputs: `mux_in` [3:0], which will be the four inputs to the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

### Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
1. **Multiplexer Inputs:**
   - The Karnaugh map's values will guide the inputs to the 4-to-1 multiplexer.
   - These values will be dependent on `c` and `d`.

### Structuring the Solution:
1. **Row-wise Association with Select Lines:**
   - We'll first define the logic for each row of the Karnaugh map based on `c` and `d`.
   - These rows can then be used as inputs to the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

### Define Intermediate Signals:
1. **Break Down the Karnaugh Map:**
    - Let's determine the values for each input of the 4-to-1 multiplexer for all combinations of `c` and `d`.

#### Truth Table Mapping:

1. For `a'b'` (sel=00):
    - c'd'== 1
    - c'd == 0
    - cd == 1
    - cd' == 1
    - => Result: 1 (from OR operation perspective)

2. For `a'b` (sel=01):
    - c'd'== 0
    - c'd == 0
    - cd == 1
    - cd' == 1
    - => Result: c

3. For `ab` (sel=11):
    - c'd'== 0
    - c'd == 0
    - cd == 1
    - cd' == 0
    - => Result: c (same result as for `a'b`)

4. For `ab'` (sel=10):
    - c'd'== 1
    - c'd == 0
    - cd == 0
    - cd' == 1
    - => Result: d'

### Mapping This Into Multiplexer Inputs:
- **mux_in[0]** (a'b'': c'd' OR cd OR cd')
- **mux_in[1]** (a'b: c)
- **mux_in[2]** (ab': d')
- **mux_in[3]** (ab): c'

### Summary:
1. **Input and Output Declarations:**
   - Inputs: `c`, `d`
   - Outputs: `mux_in[3:0]`

2. **Multiplexer Connections:**
   - mux_in[0] is derived directly from the logic function `d' OR cd OR cd'`
   - mux_in[1] is directly `c`
   - mux_in[2] is `d'`
   - mux_in[3] is `c`

### Intermediate Logic to Implement:
1. Define `mux_in[0]` logic using intermediate signals: 
    Since direct expression might be complex, we can split using logic as per needed.
2. Define `mux_in[1]` directly `c`.
3. Define `mux_in[2]` directly `d'`
4. Define `mux_in[3]` directly `c`.

Keeping this breakdown clear will support coding the desired module efficiently into Verilog. This way we ensure the K-map requirement is met while utilizing the given resources optimally.
