Sure, let's break down the steps necessary to design this finite-state machine (FSM). 

### Understand the Requirements:
1. **State Encoding and Transitions:** We have specific state transitions and output logic based on the present state and input `x`.
    - **Present state (y[2:0])** transitions and their outputs:
        - 000: Next state = 000 (if x=0) or 001 (if x=1), Output z = 0
        - 001: Next state = 001 (if x=0) or 100 (if x=1), Output z = 0
        - 010: Next state = 010 (if x=0) or 001 (if x=1), Output z = 0
        - 011: Next state = 001 (if x=0) or 010 (if x=1), Output z = 1
        - 100: Next state = 011 (if x=0) or 100 (if x=1), Output z = 1
2. **Reset Behavior:** Reset should reset the FSM to state 000.

### Determine Inputs and Outputs:
- **Inputs:** clk, reset, x
- **Outputs:** z
- **States (y[2:0]):** 000, 001, 010, 011, 100

### Define Intermediate Signals:
- **State Register:** To hold the current state of the FSM.
- **Next State Logic:** To determine the next state based on the current state and input `x`.

### Structuring the Module:

1. **Declare the state register (`y`) and output (`z`):**
    - An internal register is needed to store the current state, and a register for the output `z`.

2. **State Transition Logic:**
    - Based on the current state and input `x`, define the next state of the FSM.

3. **Output Logic:**
    - Determine the output `z` based on the current state.

4. **Sequential Logic:**
    - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock and the reset signal.
    - If the reset signal is high, reset the state to 000.
    - If the reset signal is low, update the current state to the next state.

### Pseudocode

1. **Module and Signal Declaration:**
    - Inputs: clk, reset, x
    - Outputs: z
    - Internal State: Current state register (`state`) and next state signal (`next_state`).

2. **State Definitions:**
    - Define states as parameters or localparams for readability.

3. **Next State Logic:**
    - A combinational block (always @(state or x)) to determine the next state based on the transition table.

4. **Output Logic:**
    - An assign statement or inside an always block to set `z` based on the current state.

5. **State Update:**
    - A sequential block (always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)) to update the current state and handle the reset condition.

By organizing the design this way, we ensure a clear and systematic approach to implementing the finite-state machine.
