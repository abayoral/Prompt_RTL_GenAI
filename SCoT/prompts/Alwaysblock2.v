Chain of Thought:

Understand the Requirements:
1. The task is to build an XOR gate using three different techniques in Verilog: an assign statement, a combinational always block, and a clocked always block.
2. The XOR gate function is `A XOR B`, which means the output is true when the inputs are different.

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
1. Inputs: `a`, `b` (the inputs to the XOR gate), and `clk` (used for the clocked always block).
2. Outputs: `out_assign` (output for the assign statement), `out_always_comb` (output for the combinational always block), and `out_always_ff` (output for the clocked always block).

Define Intermediate Signals:
1. Intermediate signals are not strictly necessary for this task given the simplicity of XOR logic, but internal reg variables will be necessary within the always blocks.

Structuring the Module:

1. **Assign Statement:**
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Use an `assign` statement to produce the XOR result.

2. **Combinational Always Block:**
    - Use an `always` block with the `*` (always @*) sensitivity list to describe combinational logic.
    - Within this block, directly assign the result of the XOR operation to `out_always_comb`.

3. **Clocked Always Block:**
    - Use an `always` block triggered by the `posedge clk` to describe sequential logic.
    - Inside this block, assign the XOR result to `out_always_ff`.

These techniques ensure that the XOR operation is demonstrated using different constructs to fulfill the requirement.
