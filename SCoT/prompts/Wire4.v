Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need a module with three inputs: `a`, `b`, and `c`. 
    - This module has four outputs: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
    - The connections between inputs and outputs are as follows:
        - `a` connects to `w`.
        - `b` connects to both `x` and `y`.
        - `c` connects to `z`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`
    - Outputs: `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
   - No intermediate signals are needed since the connections are direct and the values can be assigned directly to the outputs.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - **Module Declaration:** Specify the inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`) and outputs (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`).
    - **Direct Assignments:**
        - Assign `a` to `w`: This makes `w` carry the value of `a`.
        - Assign `b` to both `x` and `y`: The signal `b` is fed into two different outputs.
        - Assign `c` to `z`: This connection maps `c` directly to `z`.
    - **Use of Concatenation Operator:**
        - The hint about the concatenation operator `{}` suggests that one can facilitate the process using it.
        - Concatenate `{w, x, y, z}` and assign it to `{a, b, b, c}` to capture all the connections in one statement.

These steps will guide you in organizing the Verilog module where the specified connections are implemented without any intermediate complexity.
