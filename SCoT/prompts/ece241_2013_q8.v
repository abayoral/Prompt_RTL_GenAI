Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to design a Mealy-type FSM to detect the sequence "101" on an input signal `x`.
    - The FSM should have an output `z` which is set to 1 when the sequence "101" is detected.
    - The FSM must have an active-low asynchronous reset (`aresetn`).
    - The FSM should recognize overlapping sequences (e.g., in input "110101", both "101" sequences are recognized).
    - The design should be limited to 3 states.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs: `clk` (clock), `aresetn` (active-low asynchronous reset), `x` (input signal).
    - Output: `z` (output signal asserted to 1 when "101" sequence is detected).

3. **Identify the States:**
    - State S0: Initial state, waiting for '1'.
    - State S1: '1' detected, waiting for '0'.
    - State S2: '10' detected, waiting for '1' to complete the sequence "101".

4. **Define State Transitions:**
    - From S0:
        - If `x` is '1', transition to S1.
        - If `x` is '0', stay in S0.
    - From S1:
        - If `x` is '0', transition to S2.
        - If `x` is '1', stay in S1.
    - From S2:
        - If `x` is '1', transition back to S1 (sequence "101" detected, hence `z` is asserted).
        - If `x` is '0', stay in S2.

5. **Define Outputs:**
    - `z` is asserted to 1 in State S2 when `x` is '1'.

6. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Begin the module declaration with inputs and outputs.
    - Define an enumerated type for the states S0, S1, and S2.
    - Use a combination of an always block sensitive to `clk` and `aresetn`:
        - In case of an active-low asynchronous reset (`aresetn` not asserted), the FSM goes to state S0.
        - Within the always block, specify the state transitions based on the value of `x`.
    - Define another always block or combinational logic to set the output `z` based on the current state and input `x`.

By representing the FSM in this structured way, it becomes easy to understand and translate into Verilog code.
