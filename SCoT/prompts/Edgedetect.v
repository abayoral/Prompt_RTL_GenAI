Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - **Goal:** Detect when each bit in an 8-bit vector `in` transitions from 0 to 1 between consecutive clock cycles.
    - **Output:** The output `pedge` should indicate a 1 at the corresponding bit positions where a 0 to 1 transition occurred.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** 
        - `clk`: Clock signal.
        - `in[7:0]`: 8-bit input vector.
    - **Outputs:**
        - `pedge[7:0]`: 8-bit output vector indicating positions where a positive edge (0 to 1 transition) was detected.

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - We need to store the previous state of the input vector `in` to compare it with the current state.
    - Define an intermediate signal `in_prev` which holds the state of `in` from the previous clock cycle.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - **Module Declaration:** Start by declaring the module and specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - **Sequential Logic:** Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to capture the logic.
    - **Store Previous State:**
        - Inside the always block, store the current state of `in` into `in_prev` at the end of each clock cycle to use it for the next cycleâ€™s comparison.
    - **Positive Edge Detection:**
        - Compare each bit of the current input `in` with the corresponding bit in `in_prev`.
        - Set the corresponding bit in the output `pedge` if there is a 0 to 1 transition (i.e., `in[i]` is 1 and `in_prev[i]` is 0).
    - **Assign Output:**
        - Assign the result of the comparison to `pedge` at each clock cycle within the always block.

Summary:
- The approach involves detecting transitions by comparing the current state of each bit with its previous state.
- Store the previous state using an intermediate signal (`in_prev`).
- Detect the transition by comparing current and previous states within an always block triggered by the clock.
