Chain of Thought:

Understand the Requirements:
1. The module is a 4-bit shift register with right shift.
2. It should have an asynchronous reset that resets the shift register to zero when asserted.
3. It should have a synchronous load capability to load the shift register with the 4-bit `data` input.
4. It should have an enable signal to control the shift operation:
  - If `ena` is asserted (1), the register shifts right by one bit.
  - During the shift, the most significant bit (q[3]) becomes zero.
  - The least significant bit (q[0]) is shifted out and disappears.
5. If both `load` and `ena` are asserted (1) at the same time, `load` has higher priority, and the register should load the `data` rather than shift.

Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
- Inputs:
  - clk: Clock signal.
  - areset: Asynchronous active-high reset.
  - load: Load control signal.
  - ena: Enable control signal for the shift.
  - data: 4-bit data input to be loaded into the register.
- Output:
  - q: 4-bit output representing the contents of the shift register.

Define Intermediate Signals:
- No intermediate signals are strictly needed as the logic is relatively straightforward and can be handled directly within the procedural statements.

Structuring the Module:
1. Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
2. Use an asynchronous always block triggered by the clock signal and the asynchronous reset signal `areset`.
3. Inside the always block:
  - If `areset` is asserted (high), set `q` to zero.
  - Otherwise, check the synchronous control signals (`load` and `ena`):
    - If `load` is asserted, load the `data` into the register `q`.
    - If `load` is not asserted but `ena` is, perform the right shift operation:
      - Set q[3] to 0.
      - Shift the remaining bits (q[2:0]) into their next higher position.
  - If neither `load` nor `ena` are asserted, retain the current value of the register `q`.

End of thought process.
