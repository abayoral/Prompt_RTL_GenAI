Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The timer's control logic consists of a finite state machine (FSM) with the following behaviors:
            1. Detects a specific 4-bit pattern (1101) from a serial data input.
            2. Activates a shift enable signal (shift_ena) for exactly 4 clock cycles to shift in the next 4 bits.
            3. Waits for a counting completion signal (done_counting) while holding the counting output active.
            4. Notifies the user with a done signal and waits for an acknowledgment signal (ack) before resetting.
            5. Resets to the initial state to repeat the pattern detection.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs:
            - clk: Clock signal
            - reset: Synchronous reset signal
            - data: Serial data input
            - done_counting: Signal indicating the counters have finished counting
            - ack: Acknowledgment input from the user
        Outputs:
            - shift_ena: Enable signal for shifting in 4 bits
            - counting: Signal indicating that the FSM is waiting for counters to finish
            - done: Signal indicating the timer has timed out

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        - State encoding for FSM states.
        - Counter/Shift register to detect the pattern 1101.
        - Counter for managing the exact 4 clock cycles for shift_ena.
        
    Structuring the Module:
        1. Enumerate and Declare FSM States:
            Define states for pattern detection, enabling the shift, waiting for counting to finish, and waiting for acknowledgment.
            Example states: IDLE, PATTERN_MATCH, SHIFT, COUNTING, DONE.
        
        2. Initialize the State Machine:
            Start in the IDLE state, where the FSM searches for the 1101 pattern in the serial data input.

        3. Implement Pattern Detection Logic:
            Use a shift register to detect the pattern 1101 on the serial data input.
            Transition to the next state (SHIFT) when the pattern is detected.

        4. Shift Enable Logic:
            In the SHIFT state, assert shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles.
            Use a counter to keep track of the 4 cycles, then transition to the COUNTING state.

        5. Counting State:
            In the COUNTING state, assert the counting output and wait for the done_counting signal to go high.
            Transition to the DONE state upon done_counting equals 1.

        6. Done State Handling:
            In the DONE state, assert the done output and wait for the ack signal from the user.
            Transition back to the IDLE state upon receiving the acknowledgment.

    Summary of FSM Transitions:
        - IDLE -> PATTERN_MATCH -> SHIFT -> COUNTING -> DONE -> IDLE

    Ensure Reset Functionality:
        - On reset, ensure the FSM reinitializes to the IDLE state, clearing any intermediate signals or counters.
