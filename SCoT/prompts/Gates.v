Chain of Thought:

1. Understand the Requirements:
    - We need to design a combinational circuit that takes two single-bit inputs, `a` and `b`.
    - The circuit produces seven different outputs, each driven by a distinct logic gate applied to the inputs `a` and `b`.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
    - Inputs: `a`, `b` (both single-bit)
    - Outputs: `out_and`, `out_or`, `out_xor`, `out_nand`, `out_nor`, `out_xnor`, `out_anotb` (all single-bit)

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
    - No intermediate signals are required as each output can be directly computed from the inputs.

4. Structuring the Module:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - For each output, use an assign statement to define the output based on the corresponding logic gate.
    - `out_and` should be the result of the AND operation on `a` and `b`.
    - `out_or` should be the result of the OR operation on `a` and `b`.
    - `out_xor` should be the result of the XOR operation on `a` and `b`.
    - `out_nand` should be the result of the NAND operation on `a` and `b`.
    - `out_nor` should be the result of the NOR operation on `a` and `b`.
    - `out_xnor` should be the result of the XNOR operation on `a` and `b`.
    - `out_anotb` should be the result of the AND operation on `a` and NOT `b`.

5. Planning the Assign Statements:
    - Use basic logic operations to compute each output.
    - `out_and` = AND operation between `a` and `b`.
    - `out_or` = OR operation between `a` and `b`.
    - `out_xor` = XOR operation between `a` and `b`.
    - `out_nand` = NAND operation between `a` and `b`.
    - `out_nor` = NOR operation between `a` and `b`.
    - `out_xnor` = XNOR operation between `a` and `b`.
    - `out_anotb` = AND operation between `a` and NOT `b`.

In summary, the focus is to understand the diverse collection of logic gates required, identify the inputs and outputs, and then structure the module accordingly with suitable logic operations for each output, using assign statements for a straightforward combinational circuit design.
