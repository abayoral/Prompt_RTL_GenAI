Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A 6-to-1 multiplexer selects one of six 4-bit data inputs based on a 3-bit control signal (sel) and outputs the selected input.
        The multiplexer has six 4-bit data inputs (data0, data1, data2, data3, data4, data5), a 3-bit select input (sel), and a 4-bit output (out).
        If sel is between 0 and 5, the output (out) should be the value of the corresponding data input.
        If sel is outside this range, output (out) should be 0.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: sel [2:0], data0 [3:0], data1 [3:0], data2 [3:0], data3 [3:0], data4 [3:0], data5 [3:0]
        Output: out [3:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed because the selection logic will be handled within a case statement.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use an always block triggered by any changes in the inputs to ensure it is a combinational logic.
        Inside the always block, use a case statement based on the value of sel.
        
        - For each case (0 to 5), assign the corresponding data input to the output (out).
        - Include a default case to cover values of sel outside the range of 0 to 5, setting out to 0.

        Ensure that every possible value of the select signal (sel) is accounted for to avoid inferring latches. This is critical for combinational logic and to ensure the output is always defined.
