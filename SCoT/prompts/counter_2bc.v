Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        - The task is to build a two-bit saturating counter.
        - The counter increments (up to a maximum of 3) when train_valid and train_taken are both high (1).
        - The counter decrements (down to a minimum of 0) when train_valid is high (1) but train_taken is low (0).
        - When train_valid is low (0), the counter value remains unchanged.
        - The counter has an asynchronous reset (areset), which initializes the counter to a weakly not-taken state (2'b01).
        - The output is a two-bit value named state.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: clk, areset, train_valid, train_taken
        Output: state [1:0]

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed because the logic can be implemented directly within the always block.

    Structuring the Module:
        - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        - Use an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clock or the asynchronous reset signal (areset).
        - Inside the always block:
            - If the areset signal is high, assign the counter to 2'b01 (weakly not-taken).
            - Else if the areset signal is low and train_valid is high:
                - If train_taken is high and the counter is less than 3, increment the counter by 1.
                - If train_taken is low and the counter is greater than 0, decrement the counter by 1.
            - If train_valid is low, maintain the current counter value unchanged.
        - Ensure that all conditions are checked correctly to maintain the saturating behavior of the counter (i.e., it does not exceed the bounds of 0 and 3).
