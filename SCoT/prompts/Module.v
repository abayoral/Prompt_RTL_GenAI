### Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We have been provided with a module `mod_a`.
    - `mod_a` has three ports: `in1`, `in2`, and `out`.
    - We are to create a top-level module that instantiates `mod_a`.
    - We need to connect `mod_a`'s ports to the top-level module's ports.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Inputs of the top-level module: `a`, `b`
    - Output of the top-level module: `out`

3. **Identify Connections:**
    - Connect the inputs of `mod_a` (i.e., `in1`, `in2`) to the top-level inputs (`a`, `b`) respectively.
    - Connect the output of `mod_a` (i.e., `out`) to the top-level output (`out`).

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration for the top-level module, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Inside the top-level module, instantiate `mod_a`.
    - Use the instantiation to map `mod_a`'s ports to the top-level module's ports.
        - Connect `in1` of `mod_a` to input `a` of the top-level module.
        - Connect `in2` of `mod_a` to input `b` of the top-level module.
        - Connect `out` of `mod_a` to output `out` of the top-level module.

5. **Pseudocode Outline:**
    - Begin with the declaration of the top-level module, including `input a`, `input b`, and `output out`.
    - Inside the top-level module, create an instance of `mod_a`.
    - Map the ports of the instance to the top-level ports (`a`, `b`, `out`).

By following these steps, we can methodically design the top-level module that correctly instantiates `mod_a` and establishes the required connections.
