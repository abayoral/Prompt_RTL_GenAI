Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        The task is to create a module that implements an XNOR gate.
        An XNOR gate gives a true (1) output when the number of true (1) inputs is even.
        For two inputs A and B, the XNOR operation results in true (1) if both A and B are the same (both 0 or both 1).
        The task can be simplified by realizing that an XNOR gate is the negation of an XOR gate.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a, b
        Output: out

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed because the logic can be directly implemented using an assign statement.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Use an assign statement to define the output (out).
        Use the bitwise-XOR operator (^) to compute the XOR of inputs a and b.
        Negate the result of the XOR operation to implement the XNOR function.
        Assign this negated result to the output (out).
