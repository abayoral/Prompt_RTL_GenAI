Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        This task involves creating a circuit that compares two 2-bit inputs, A and B, and produces an output z.
        The output z should be 1 if the value of A is equal to the value of B; otherwise, z should be 0.
        
    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: A[1:0], B[1:0]
        Output: z

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed.

    Structuring the Module:
        - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        - Implement comparison logic to check if the value of A is equal to the value of B.
        - Use an assign statement for z to perform the comparison.
        - If A is equal to B, assign 1 to z. Otherwise, assign 0 to z. 

The implementation will be straightforward, utilizing a basic comparison operation to achieve the desired functionality.
