Chain of Thought: 

1. Understand the Requirements:
    - This module should implement a basic combinational logic function where the output `z` is determined by the expression \( z = (x \oplus y) \& x \).
    - The function includes a bitwise XOR operation between inputs `x` and `y`, and then a bitwise AND operation between the result and `x`.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
    - Inputs: `x`, `y`
    - Output: `z`

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
    - An intermediate signal is needed to store the result of the XOR operation temporary.

4. Structuring the Module:
    - Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
    - Create an intermediate signal to hold the result of `x` XOR `y`.
    - Use an assign statement to compute the intermediate result.
    - Use another assign statement to compute the final output `z` by ANDing the intermediate result with `x`.

This approach ensures that the process is broken down into clear and manageable steps, facilitating accurate and efficient implementation of the required logic function.
