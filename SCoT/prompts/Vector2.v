Chain of Thought:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    - We need to build a circuit that will reverse the byte ordering of a 4-byte word.
    - The input is a 32-bit word (in), which consists of four 8-bit bytes.
    - The output is a 32-bit word (out), where the byte ordering is reversed.
    - For example, if the input is structured as `A[7:0] B[7:0] C[7:0] D[7:0]`, the output should be `D[7:0] C[7:0] B[7:0] A[7:0]`.

2. **Determine the Inputs and Outputs:**
    - Input: `in[31:0]`
    - Output: `out[31:0]`

3. **Define Intermediate Signals:**
    - No intermediate signals are needed since the operation can be done directly with part-selects and assignments.

4. **Structuring the Module:**
    - Start with the module declaration that includes the input and output.
    - Use part-select to specify the byte ordering.
    - Assign the bytes from the input to the output in reverse order:
        - The most significant byte of `in` should be assigned to the least significant byte of `out`.
        - The second most significant byte of `in` should be assigned to the second least significant byte of `out`.
        - The third most significant byte of `in` should be assigned to the third least significant byte of `out`.
        - The least significant byte of `in` should be assigned to the most significant byte of `out`.

5. **Implementation Steps:**
    - Use an `assign` statement to assign `out[31:24]` to `in[7:0]`.
    - Use an `assign` statement to assign `out[23:16]` to `in[15:8]`.
    - Use an `assign` statement to assign `out[15:8]` to `in[23:16]`.
    - Use an `assign` statement to assign `out[7:0]` to `in[31:24]`.

By following these steps, the byte ordering of the 4-byte word will be successfully reversed.
