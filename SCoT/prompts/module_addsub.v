Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A 32-bit wide XOR gate inverts the b input whenever sub is 1, which is equivalent to b[31:0] XORed with sub replicated 32 times.
        Our objective is to create an adder-subtractor module. For this, the sub input is connected to the carry-in of the adder. 
        An XOR gate can be thought of as a programmable inverter, where one input controls if the other will be inverted.

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Inputs: a, b, sub
        Output: sum

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        Create a signal b_invert which is the XOR of b and sub.
        Create signals carry and sum_16bit where sum_16bit represents the sum of 16-bit adder.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Declare an instance of the add16 module, passing it the lower 16 bits of a and b_invert, and sub as cin.
        Output of this instance will be carry and sum_16bit, connect sum_16bit with lower 16 bits of sum.
        Declare another instance of the add16 module, now passing the higher 16 bits of a and b_invert, and carry from previous instance as cin.
        Output of this second instance will be an unused wire and sum_16bit, connect sum_16bit with higher 16 bits of sum.
        Thus, our adder subtractor works by either adding a and b (when sub=0) or adding a and 2's complement of b (when sub=1) creating subtraction.
