Chain of Thought:

    Understand the Requirements:
        A priority encoder reports the least significant bit in a given 8-bit input vector that is high (1).
        If no bits are high in the input vector, the output should be 0.
        For instance, if the input vector is 8'b10010000, the output should be 3'd4 as the 4th bit is the first one with a high value (when counting from least significant bit).

    Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
        Input: in[7:0] (8-bit vector)
        Output: pos[2:0] (3-bit result indicating the position of least significant bit that is high)

    Define Intermediate Signals:
        No intermediate signals are needed.

    Structuring the Module:
        Start with the module declaration, specifying the inputs and outputs.
        Begin with initialization of output pos (position) to zero (no bit is high).
        Check for each bit in the input vector (from least significant bit to most significant bit):
            If a bit is high, update the position to the index of that bit and break the loop (as we report only the least significant high bit).
        This should be implemented within an always block triggered by changes in input vector.
        Finally, the 3-bit position value represents the first high bit in the input vector, or zero if no bits are high.
