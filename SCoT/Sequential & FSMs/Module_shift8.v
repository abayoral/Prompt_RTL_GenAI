You have been provided with a module designated as `my_dff8`, which is designed to function with two inputs and a single output, specifically implementing a set of eight D flip-flops. Your task is to instantiate this module three separate times and interconnect (or chain) these instances together to form an 8-bit wide shift register with a total length of three stages. Essentially, this configuration will enable you to pass data through the shift register across three clock cycles. 

Additionally, you are required to design a 4-to-1 multiplexer, which is not provided as part of the initial setup. This multiplexer will be responsible for selecting what specific data to output based on a selection input, `sel[1:0]`. The selection logic for the multiplexer should allow it to choose from four different states: 
1. The direct input data `d`, 
2. The data after one stage (one D flip-flop), 
3. The data after two stages (two D flip-flops), 
4. The data after three stages (three D flip-flops). 

In simple terms, the value of `sel` determines how many clock cycles the input data should be delayed before it is outputted, allowing for a range of zero to three clock cycles of delay. Note that the design and implementation of the 4-to-1 multiplexer is up to you, but one possible approach is to construct it within an `always` block using a `case` statement to handle the selection logic based on `sel`.

Lastly, you need to encapsulate this entire design within a top-level module named `top_module` that accommodates inputs for the clock, the data input `d`, and the selection `sel`, along with an output for the resulting delayed data `q`. 

Be sure to consider how the connections will be made between the instances of `my_dff8` and how the multiplexer will interface with these stages to provide the correct output based on the `sel` input.
