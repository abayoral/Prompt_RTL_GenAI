You are tasked with implementing a digital logic module, specifically a D flip-flop, using a hardware description language (HDL). The module is defined under the name `top_module`. Here are the specifications you need to follow:

- **Inputs**: The module has two inputs:
  - `clk`: This represents the clock signal for the flip-flop. The clock signal is used to synchronize the storage of the input data.
  - `in`: This input represents the data signal which the flip-flop will capture and store on the triggering edge of the clock signal.

- **Output**: The module has one output:
  - `out`: This output is the stored value from the input `in`. On the triggering edge of the clock signal, the value of `in` is captured and stored, and then driven to the output `out`.

- **Behavior**: The D flip-flop should capture and store the value of the `in` signal on a specific edge (either rising or falling, depending on design requirements, which should be determined) of the `clk` input. Once the clock edge occurs, the captured value should be immediately reflected to the `out` signal.

Embed your logic within the provided module framework. The comment `// Insert your code here` indicates where to place your HDL code to implement the desired digital logic. You should ensure that your implementation correctly adheres to the standard characteristics of a D flip-flop, such as avoiding metastability and handling any asynchronous reset if required by additional design specifications.

Can you provide the necessary code to achieve this within the confines of the given module structure? This involves understanding how to capture and propagate signal changes based on clock edges in digital circuit design using HDL.
