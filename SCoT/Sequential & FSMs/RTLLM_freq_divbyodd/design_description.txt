As a professional Verilog designer, consider the task of creating a frequency divider module that divides an input clock signal by an odd divisor value, with the name `freq_divbyodd`. The design of this module requires you to implement specific functionality with both input and output ports and utilize parameters to customize the divider's behavior.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the requirements for this Verilog module:

1. **Module Name**: `freq_divbyodd`
   - The name reflects its functionality—dividing a frequency by an odd number.

2. **Input Ports**:
   - `clk`: The input clock signal that you want to divide.
   - `rst_n`: An active low reset signal. When active, it should initialize or reset the module's internal state, ensuring the counters and outputs are reset appropriately.

3. **Output Port**:
   - `clk_div`: This will be the output signal representing the divided clock. It's the frequency-divided version of the input `clk` signal.

4. **Design Requirements**:
   - **Parameter**: `NUM_DIV`—This parameter determines the divisor value and defaults to 5. It must be an odd number since the module is designed to divide the input clock by odd values.
   - **Counters**: Two counters, `cnt1` and `cnt2`, are necessary. These counters individually track the clock's rising and falling edges, respectively, and will count up to `NUM_DIV - 1`.
   - **Separate Clock Dividers**: Use two distinct dividers, `clk_div1` for the rising edge and `clk_div2` for the falling edge. These dividers should toggle when the corresponding counter reaches half of `NUM_DIV`.
   - **Combined Output**: The output, `clk_div`, is generated by logically OR-ing the individual dividers `clk_div1` and `clk_div2`. This ensures that both positive and negative clock edges are considered in the divided clock output.

5. **Reset Functionality**: The `rst_n` signal should ensure both counters and divider outputs are reset to a known initial state when activated. This will prevent any erroneous outputs or states in the clock division process.

With the above details in mind, this module allows you to implement a flexible clock dividing mechanism where the divider can be adjusted by changing the `NUM_DIV` parameter, providing versatility for various application requirements.
