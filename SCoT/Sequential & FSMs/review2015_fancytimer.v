The task at hand is to design a digital circuit, specifically a timer, which operates under a defined sequence of events controlled by an input. The system must be sensitive to a serialized data stream arriving at a designated input pin and be capable of recognizing a specific initial bit pattern "1101" as a trigger. The key steps involved in this design are as follows:

1. **Pattern Detection**: The circuit should continuously monitor the incoming data bits and identify when the specified pattern "1101" appears. This detection acts as the trigger to initiate the second stage of the operation.

2. **Input for Timer Duration**: Upon successful detection of the "1101" pattern, the system is required to shift in the subsequent four bits from the data stream. These bits, provided in a most-significant-to-least-significant order, are crucial as they define the delay duration for the timer. This four-bit sequence is stored and referred to as `delay[3:0]`.

3. **Timer Activation and Counting Phase**: Once the `delay[3:0]` bits are determined, the timer must be activated. During this phase, the circuit should count down for a calculated number of cycles. Specifically, the timer will run for `(delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000` clock cycles, meaning each increment of the delay value increases the counting duration by 1000 cycles. During this counting phase, it is vital for the system to update and output the remaining time, decrementing from the initial delay value down to zero, with each step corresponding to a 1000-cycle duration.

4. **Timing Completion and User Notification**: After completing the requisite counting period, the system should signal the end of the countdown by asserting a `done` signal. This alerts the user that the designated time interval has lapsed.

5. **Acknowledgment and Reset**: Following the countdown completion and user notification, the system awaits the user's acknowledgment, indicated by an input signal `ack`. Once this acknowledgment is received, the timer resets itself, ready to detect the next instance of the "1101" sequence to restart the process.

Throughout this design, state management is crucial as the circuit transitions between detecting the initial pattern, processing subsequent inputs, counting, and awaiting user interaction. It should be built as a state machine with delineated states according to these stages. The reset functionality should ensure that the system reverts to its initial state and becomes ready to detect a new pattern without further initialization from an external source. It is also suggested that while a single module may contain all logic, distinct parts should be organized within separate always blocks for clarity and maintainability. Avoid merging multiple logical operations in one block as this could increase complexity and introduce potential errors.
