As a seasoned Verilog designer, you're tasked with creating a Verilog module named `multi_pipe_8bit`. This module's core function is multiplying two unsigned 8-bit numbers using a pipeline architecture, which is helpful for maintaining high throughput. To achieve this, you'll incorporate several specific features and signals, outlined in this comprehensive description:

**Module Definition and Input/Output Ports:**

1. **Module Name:**
   - `multi_pipe_8bit`

2. **Input Ports:**
   - `clk`: This is the clock signal driving synchronous operations within the module. You will utilize this signal to coordinate timing.
   - `rst_n`: An active-low reset signal, used to reset the internal logic. When this signal is 0, it implies a reset condition, and when it's 1, the logic operates normally.
   - `mul_en_in`: This enable signal initiates the multiplication process when asserted active.
   - `mul_a` and `mul_b`: These are the multiplicand and multiplier inputs respectively, with both having a data width of 8 bits.

3. **Output Ports:**
   - `mul_en_out`: A signal indicating when the multiplication operation is valid, derived from internal logic, most likely dependent on the when inputs are captured and processed.
   - `mul_out`: This carries the final 16-bit product resulting from multiplying `mul_a` and `mul_b`.

**Architecture Explanation:**

To implement this module, you'll follow a systematic approach involving several architectural components, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. **Input Control:**
   - The input enable signal (`mul_en_in`) should be sampled on the positive edge of the clock. This initiates the multiplication process.
   - Store this enable state in a register (`mul_en_out_reg`). The most significant bit of this register will dictate the status of `mul_en_out`, which flags when multiplication is valid.

2. **Input Registers:**
   - Use registers `mul_a_reg` and `mul_b_reg` to hold input values securely across cycles. They should update with new inputs on a clock edge only if `mul_en_in` is active.

3. **Partial Product Generation:**
   - Create several wires (`temp`) for partial products. These are intermediate products generated by computing bitwise operations between bits of `mul_b` and the full 8-bit width of `mul_a`.
   - Conditional assignments help select relevant bits for constructing each partial product in a bit position-specific manner.

4. **Partial Sum Calculation:**
   - Further refine the solution by summing the partial products. This involves an internal set of registers (`sum`), where each corresponds to computed groups of partial products.
   - Update these registers in sync with the clock edge, allowing summation to proceed through stages.

5. **Final Product Calculation:**
   - Aggregate these partial sums to form the final product. Store this entire combined value in another register (`mul_out_reg`), which represents the resolved product at any point in time.
   - This register is updated each clock cycle to reflect the summed contributions from partial computations.

6. **Output Assignment:**
   - The `mul_out` output is derived from the value held in `mul_out_reg`, depending on the state of `mul_en_out`.
   - If `mul_en_out` is active, indicating readiness, the value of `mul_out_reg` is handed off to `mul_out`.
   - If not active, `mul_out` is set to 0, maintaining output integrity during inactive states.

As you design this module, ensure logical consistency between the input enable control, pipeline stages, and the nal product assignment. Your goal is to effectively utilize pipelining for performance gains while adhering to the specific behavioral requirements outlined.
