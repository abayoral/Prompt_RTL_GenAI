You have been trained using data available up until October 2023, which may not include any updates or developments that have occurred after this period. Now, acting as a professional Verilog designer, let's consider the task at hand.

Your goal is to implement a Verilog module named `accu` that performs serial accumulation of input data. The design requirements are as follows:

1. **Module Functionality**: 
   - This module should accumulate groups of four 8-bit input data values (`data_in`) into a single output. 
   - The input data should be ready when `valid_in` is high.

2. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Inputs**: 
     - `clk`: This is the clock signal that times all operations within your module, ensuring they are synchronized.
     - `rst_n`: An active-low reset signal that, when asserted low, should reset or initialize the module's internals to a known state.
     - `data_in [7:0]`: An 8-bit input representing the data to be accumulated. This input is considered valid only when `valid_in` is high.
     - `valid_in`: A control signal indicating that `data_in` contains valid data ready for processing. The module should only process `data_in` when `valid_in` is high.

   - **Outputs**:
     - `valid_out`: A signal that indicates when the accumulation of four `data_in` samples is complete. It should pulse high for one clock cycle each time the accumulated result is ready.
     - `data_out [9:0]`: A 10-bit output that represents the sum of four accumulated `data_in` values. The need for a 10-bit width arises to accommodate the potential overflow from adding four 8-bit numbers.

3. **Design Implementation Details**:
   - **Data Accumulation**: 
     - Start accumulating `data_in` values into a running total when `valid_in` is asserted.
     - Keep track of the number of valid data samples received using an internal counter.
     - Accumulate values until you have received four valid samples.

   - **Output Logic**: 
     - Once four valid data samples are accumulated, output the sum on `data_out`.
     - Simultaneously, assert `valid_out` for exactly one clock cycle to signal that `data_out` contains valid accumulated data.
     - After outputting, reset the internal counter and accumulator to prepare for the next set of four inputs.

4. **Behavior During Reset**:
   - The module should reset its state, counter, and accumulator when the `rst_n` signal is low, regardless of the `clk`.

These specifications serve as an expanded explanation of what the module needs to accomplish. Now, it is important to focus on implementing this functionality in Verilog, keeping these requirements in mind.
