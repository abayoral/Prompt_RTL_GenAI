The problem presented involves designing the combinational logic necessary for a Moore state machine with specific state and output behavior, as described by a given transition table. Here are the key elements you need to consider:

1. **State Encoding:** Four states are to be represented using 2-bit binary codes as follows: State A is `2'b00`, State B is `2'b01`, State C is `2'b10`, and State D is `2'b11`.

2. **Inputs and Outputs:** The state machine has a single binary input represented as `in`, and outputs two primary variables: `next_state` (a 2-bit signal reflecting the next state the machine transitions into) and `out` (a single-bit signal indicating the output associated with the current state).

3. **State Transition Table:**
   - **State A:** When the machine is in State A and the input `in` is 0, it remains in State A; if `in` is 1, it transitions to State B. The output in State A is 0.
   - **State B:** From State B, if `in` is 0, the machine transitions to State C; if `in` is 1, it remains in State B. The output in State B is 0.
   - **State C:** In State C, a 0 at the input will transition the machine back to State A, while a 1 will transition it to State D. The output in State C is 0.
   - **State D:** When in State D, if `in` is 0, the state transitions to State C; if `in` is 1, it changes to State B. The output in State D is 1.

4. **Design Tasks:**
   - You need to design the **state transition logic**, which involves determining the `next_state` based on the current `state` and the input `in`, according to the rules specified in the transition table.
   - Design the **output logic**, where the `out` output should be generated based on the current state (not the input) since it's a Moore machine. This means that `out` remains constant throughout a state, irrespective of the input changes, until a state transition occurs.

The task is to complete this combinational logic portion in a Verilog module called `top_module`. Your main goal is to ensure the logic accurately reflects the described behavior and transitions according to the specified conditions for both state transitions and output management.
