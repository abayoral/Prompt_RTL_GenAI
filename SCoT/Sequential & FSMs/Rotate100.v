The task requires designing a digital circuit module that acts as a 100-bit left/right rotator with the capability of a synchronous load operation and direction-specific rotation based on enable signals. A rotator in this context is distinct from a simple shifter; the primary functionality involves cycling the bits within a register, meaning the bit shifted out of one end is entered back into the opposite end, preserving the continuity of the bit sequence throughout the rotation operation.

1. **Operation Description**:
   - **Synchronous Load**: This functionality allows the entire 100-bit register to be loaded with a new set of data provided by an external source, denoted as `data[99:0]`. This process is synchronous, meaning it is aligned with the clock signal `clk`.
   - **Enable (`ena[1:0]`)**: The `ena` signal is a 2-bit code that dictates the operation at any given time:
     - `2'b01`: Initiates a rotation to the right by one bit position. In a right rotation, the least significant bit (LSB) is moved to the most significant bit (MSB) position, and the rest of the bits are shifted rightward.
     - `2'b10`: Initiates a rotation to the left by one bit position. For left rotation, the MSB is moved to the LSB position, and all other bits shift leftward.
     - `2'b00` and `2'b11`: These codes imply that the rotator remains idle with respect to rotation, maintaining its current state without change.
   
2. **Module Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `clk`: The clock input triggering synchronous operations.
     - `load`: A control signal to dictate whether the register should load new data or perform a rotation.
     - `ena`: A 2-bit vector to select the rotational direction and activity.
     - `data[99:0]`: The 100-bit input data line, holding data to load into the register when `load` is active.
   - **Outputs**:
     - `q[99:0]`: This register holds the current state of the bits post any operation (load or rotate), reflecting the ongoing contents impacted by the control signals.

3. **Purpose and Constraints**:
   - The purpose of designing this module is to ensure flexible and dynamic data handling in digital systems where data continuity during bit manipulation is crucial.
   - The design must not discard or lose any bits during rotation, fulfilling strict operation integrity while handling control input states accurately.

This design requires a sequential circuit implementation leveraging the rules and constraints outlined, effectively managing data via the clock-driven load and enable signals, encapsulating robust rotation logic.
