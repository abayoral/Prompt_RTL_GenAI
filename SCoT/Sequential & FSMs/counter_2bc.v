Design and implement a two-bit saturating counter in a hardware description language module. The counter should have specific behaviors based on input signals and an asynchronous reset feature. The module should include the following specifications and functionalities:

1. **Input Signals:**
   - `clk`: A clock signal that will be used to synchronize the counter's behavior with the system clock.
   - `areset`: An asynchronous reset signal. When this signal is active, it resets the counter to a predefined state regardless of the clock.
   - `train_valid`: A signal indicating the validity of a training operation. When set to 1, it specifies that either an increment or decrement operation should be performed, depending on the state of `train_taken`.
   - `train_taken`: A signal influencing the counter's behavior when `train_valid` is active. If `train_taken` is 1, the counter should increment; if it is 0, the counter should decrement.

2. **Counter Behavior:**
   - The counter is a two-bit saturating counter that can hold values between 0 and 3.
   - **Increment Logic:** When `train_valid` is 1 and `train_taken` is also 1, the counter's value should increment by 1, up to a maximum value of 3.
   - **Decrement Logic:** When `train_valid` is 1 and `train_taken` is 0, the counter should decrement by 1, but not below a minimum value of 0.
   - The counter should maintain its current value if `train_valid` is 0, regardless of the value of `train_taken`.

3. **Asynchronous Reset:**
   - When the `areset` signal is active, it should immediately set the counter to a "weakly not-taken" state, represented by the binary value `2'b01`.

4. **Output Specification:**
   - `state`: A 2-bit output representing the current value of the counter. It reflects the count value updated according to the described logic of validation, taken state, and asynchronous reset.

5. **Consideration for Implementation:**
   - The implementation should correctly handle transitions between different states as dictated by the input signals.
   - Ensure proper handling of edge cases such as reaching maximum or minimum counts and the impact of asynchronous reset at any point.

Develop the module by inserting the appropriate logic to handle all specified behaviors effectively, using constructs available within the hardware description language for clocked and asynchronous operations.
