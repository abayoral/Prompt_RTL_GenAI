The task at hand involves designing a hardware module in a hardware description language, likely SystemVerilog or Verilog. This module should specifically implement eight D flip-flops. Each of these flip-flops should operate based on the following specifications:

1. **Active High Synchronous Reset**: The reset functionality must be synchronous with the clock, meaning that the reset takes effect only on a particular clock transition, specifically when a certain condition is met on the reset signal (active high in this case).

2. **Reset Value**: Upon activation of the reset signal, these flip-flops should not reset to the typical all-zero state (0x00). Instead, they should reset to a hexadecimal value of 0x34. This means when the reset signal is activated and the synchronous condition is met, the output of the flip-flops should reflect this specific pattern.

3. **Negative Edge Triggered Clk**: The clock signal should trigger the flip-flops' operations on its falling edge. Normally, operations in digital circuits occur on either the rising edge or the falling edge of the clock, and in this case, it is specified to trigger on the negative or falling edge.

4. **D Flip-Flop Inputs and Outputs**: The module must include inputs for the clock (`clk`), the reset signal (`reset`), and an 8-bit data input (`d`). The outputs should be a corresponding 8-bit wide bus (`q`) which represents the state of the eight D flip-flops.

5. **Presetting vs Resetting**: The hint provided in the prompt mentions that resetting a register to '1' is sometimes called "preset". In this context, itâ€™s relevant to note that when dealing with initialization states of flip-flops, specifically setting certain bits high rather than a typical all-low reset.

The main purpose is to construct this module so that it adheres to the above requirements, paying particular attention to the behavior of the reset condition and the clock edge on which the flip-flops should respond. The design should encapsulate correct signal handling within the module interfacing, ensuring the desired output state, 0x34, under the initialized reset conditions.
