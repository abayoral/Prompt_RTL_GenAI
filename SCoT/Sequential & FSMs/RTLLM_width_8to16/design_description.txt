You have the task of demonstrating your skills as a professional Verilog designer by implementing a digital circuit specifically for data width conversion. The objective is to design a module that can transform an 8-bit input data stream into a 16-bit output while handling data processing and validity signaling across clock cycles. This circuit needs to intelligently manage the arrival of sequential 8-bit data inputs and pair them to produce valid 16-bit output data.

Your assignment is to design a module named `width_8to16`, which includes handling various input and output ports:

1. **Input Ports:**
   - `clk`: This is the clock signal responsible for synchronizing the operations of the circuitry.
   - `rst_n`: An active-low reset signal; a value of 0 implicates a reset condition, clearing internal states, while a value of 1 means the reset is not activated.
   - `valid_in`: A signal indicating when the input data (`data_in`) is ready and valid for processing.
   - `data_in`: An 8-bit data input that needs conversion to a wider 16-bit format.

2. **Output Ports:**
   - `valid_out`: An output signal that denotes when the processed output data (`data_out`) is valid and can be relied upon.
   - `data_out`: The 16-bit result of the data width transformation, combining two sequential 8-bit inputs.

**Integration Details:**
- The functionality should leverage the clock's positive edge (`posedge clk`) for state changes and the negative edge of the reset (`negedge rst_n`) for resetting operations.
- When the reset is active (i.e., `!rst_n`), the output `data_out` should be cleared to ensure no residual data counts as valid upon resumption.
- The module should demonstrate capability in handling sequential 8-bit data processing: upon detecting a valid input (`valid_in` is true), store the incoming data for the formation of a higher-order data word. The critical rule is that the first 8-bit input captured should populate the higher 8 bits of `data_out`, waiting for a subsequent data input to complete the lower 8 bits.
- `valid_out` should only become active after two 8-bit data segments are available, ensuring that `data_out` outputs a complete and valid 16-bit result.

Your goal is to implement this behavior using Verilog, adeptly managing internal storage for the interim data through registers and employing necessary control logic and state machines to achieve the specification requirements. Prepare a robust and well-structured code that effectively captures this conversion logic, including appropriate handling of data validity and synchronization operations.
