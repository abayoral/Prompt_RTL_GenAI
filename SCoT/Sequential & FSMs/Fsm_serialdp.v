The task at hand involves modifying an existing finite state machine (FSM) and datapath to incorporate parity checking into a serial data receiver system. The goal is to implement odd parity checking for data transmission. Letâ€™s elaborate on what odd parity checking entails and how it interacts with the components mentioned in your module.

Parity checking is a form of error detection that adds an extra bit, called the parity bit, to each data byte. In the system we are interested in, we use odd parity. This means that for every 9-bit sequence (8 data bits plus 1 parity bit), the number of bits set to '1' should be odd. For instance, the binary sequence 101001011 contains five '1's, thereby satisfying the odd parity requirement. In contrast, the sequence 001001011 has an even number of '1's (four), which does not satisfy odd parity.

Your task is to modify the given FSM and datapath to not only receive and interpret serial data but also to verify the integrity of received data by ensuring the odd parity condition is met. The FSM starts by identifying a start bit which signals the beginning of a transmission. Following the start bit, the FSM waits to receive an entire 9-bit sequence comprised of the 8 data bits and the parity bit. After receiving these bits, the FSM must verify the stop bit. If the expected stop bit is not found, the FSM should continue monitoring the input stream until it successfully locates a stop bit before proceeding to receive the next byte of data.

You are provided with a module called `parity` that calculates the parity of the input bit stream using a toggle flip flop (TFF) with reset. You need to strategically determine when to reset this module to ensure it correctly processes each byte. This means that for each byte of data, you must reset the `parity` module at the start and apply it to each bit in the stream to ensure it reflects the correct parity state by the time the parity bit is evaluated.

The task also requires that the `done` signal is set high only when a byte is accurately and completely received, inclusive of a correct parity check. 

Another important aspect to consider is the specific data format: the protocol dictates that the least significant bit (LSB) is transmitted first, followed by the additional parity bit after all 8 data bits are sent. 

Implementing these changes successfully will involve altering the FSM states to account for the extra parity bit and ensuring that the sequence of processes result in a proper parity check before asserting that the received byte is valid. Your design should harmoniously integrate with the given module and achieve the new task requirements while maintaining or modifying the existing system structure as needed.

In your implementation, consider all of these elements and their interactions while ensuring efficient and accurate serial data reception with parity checking.
