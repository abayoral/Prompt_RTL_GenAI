To clarify the task at hand: You need to monitor an 8-bit wide input vector over consecutive clock cycles. The goal is to detect instances where any bit within this vector transitions from a logic level 0 in the current clock cycle to a logic level 1 in the following clock cycle. This transition is known as a positive edge detection. Once such a transition is identified for any bit, the corresponding bit in the output vector named `pedge` should be set to 1 on the subsequent clock cycle. 

In more detail, for each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in`, you need to check and determine when a transition from 0 to 1 occurs. Upon detecting this positive edge in any individual bit, you should reflect this detection by setting the equivalent bit in the output vector `pedge` to 1 on the next clock cycle. The detection and setting of the output should be edge-sensitive, meaning that only the transition from 0 to 1 should be recognized and cause the output bit to be set, while no change or the opposite transition (1 to 0) should not affect the output bit.

This detection needs to be implemented in hardware description language (HDL) using a given module template with a clock signal input `clk`, the 8-bit input `in`, and the 8-bit output `pedge` that you need to define and manipulate based on the described transition detection logic.
