The problem involves creating a system to interpret messages from a PS/2 mouse communication protocol. This protocol sends data as continuous streams of bytes, where each individual message comprises three bytes. The challenge lies in delineating these messages within the stream, as it is not immediately clear where one message ends and another begins. 

The key to solving this is leveraging the protocol's rule: the first byte of each message always has its third bit (bit[3]) set to '1'. In contrast, this bit in the subsequent two bytes of the message might be either '1' or '0', depending on the data. Thus, when processing the byte stream, any byte encountered with bit[3] set to '1' is speculated to be the start of a new message. 

Starting from this initial byte, the system would keep track of and accumulate the next two bytes into a complete 3-byte message set. Once all three bytes are captured, the system should signal the successful reception of a message. 

The task now involves enhancing an existing finite state machine (FSM) designed to identify these three-byte message boundaries. The goal is to integrate a datapath into this machine that will assemble the bytes into a complete 24-bit message. This means taking the three sequential bytes, placing the first byte into the most significant eight bits (out_bytes[23:16]), the second byte into the middle (out_bytes[15:8]), and the third byte into the least significant eight bits (out_bytes[7:0]) of a 24-bit output variable. 

Moreover, the value in out_bytes should be considered valid precisely when the message has been entirely received, as indicated by the 'done' signal. At times when no complete message is detected (the 'done' signal is low), the values in out_bytes are unspecified or 'don't-care'. 

The module, structurally defined with inputs for clock (clk), an 8-bit input stream (in), and a synchronous reset signal (reset), is to be designed such that it implements this protocol detection and data capture functionality effectively.
