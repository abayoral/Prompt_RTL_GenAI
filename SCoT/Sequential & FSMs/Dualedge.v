Consider the challenge of constructing a circuit that mimics the functionality of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). In traditional digital design, flip-flops can be sensitive to either the rising (positive edge) or falling (negative edge) transitions of a clock signal. However, in this scenario, the goal is to design a flip-flop that responds to changes on both the rising and falling edges of a clock signalâ€”essentially a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. 

Despite this objective, one must account for a key limitation: FPGAs inherently lack native support for dual-edge triggered flip-flops. Consequently, the standard syntax in Verilog, typically used to describe sensitivity to both rising and falling clock edges (always @(posedge clk or negedge clk)), is not valid within the FPGA's design constraints.

To circumvent these hardware limitations while still achieving the desired functionality, consider devising a schematic that leverages existing FPGA resources. Specifically, try to conceptualize a strategy that utilizes both positive-edge triggered and negative-edge triggered flip-flops to collaboratively emulate the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop. Keep in mind that the core of this task is a circuit design problem rather than a mere coding exercise; thus, an initial manual sketch of the circuit can provide critical insights before translating the design into Verilog code. 

With the task clearly defined, proceed to model and implement a Verilog module that aligns with these specifications. Your module should accept a clock signal (clk) and a data input (d), and output a signal (q) that reflects the intended dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior.
