In your task, you're given a finite state machine configuration represented by a state-assigned table, which includes present states, next states based on the input 'x', and specific output conditions. Your objective is to implement the logic functions for the signals Y[0] and z, based on this configuration.

**State-Assigned Table Analysis:**

1. **Present State (y[2:0])**: These are the current states of a 3-bit wide state variable, which must be considered in your design.

2. **Next State (Y[2:0])**: Based on the present state and the input 'x', this column indicates the next state of the system. The table splits into two potential next states per present state, conditional on whether 'x' is 0 or 1.

3. **Output (z)**: The table provides an output, z, which is either 0 or 1, for each present state regardless of the value of 'x'. 

**Task:**

Your task is to write the Verilog module `top_module` which incorporates this state table logic into the calculation of outputs Y0 (the least significant bit of the next state Y[2:0]) and the signal z. The inputs to your module include a clock signal `clk` (though unused in this particular table) and two other signals: the present state `y` (3-bit wide) and the input `x` (1-bit).

**Considerations:**

- You need to control the transitions between states correctly while maintaining the output value `z` as outlined in the table.
  
- Remember to focus on decoding the present state `y` to determine the correct transition based on `x`. For example, identify logic that dictates when to transition from 000 to either 000 or 001 based on x, etc.

- Since the task is to derive Y0, ensure to extract the logic specifically for Y0, based on the conditions provided in the state table. 

By accurately interpreting these elements, you can implement the Verilog code that models this particular state machine within the `top_module`. Although the table doesn't explicitly indicate a reset condition or initialization, consider if your implementation needs any such conditions based on the broader project constraints or additional specifications not depicted in this table alone.  

Note: In your coding context, pay attention to any additional requirements regarding sequential logic design or state transition mechanisms which might involve synchronization with the `clk`.
