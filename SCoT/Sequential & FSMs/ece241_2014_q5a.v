You are tasked with designing a serial 2's complementer Moore state machine that processes a one-input, one-output bit stream. This machine should be developed as a Verilog module and should be capable of dealing with input numbers of arbitrary length, with each bit of the input (denoted as 'x') arriving serially in a least-significant-bit-first order, synchronized to a given clock ('clk'). The main goal is to convert this input stream into its 2's complement form, then output this as a corresponding single-bit stream ('z').

Considerations and requirements include:

1. **Moore State Machine Configuration**: 
   - The machine you design is a Moore type, meaning the output is determined solely by the current state, not the input conditions.
  
2. **2's Complement Calculation**:
   - For each bit of the input stream, calculate the 2's complement equivalent. This involves inverting the bits and adding one, starting from the least-significant bit since the input begins with it.

3. **Reset Functionality**:
   - The module must incorporate an asynchronous reset ('areset'). When this reset is asserted, the machine must stop processing and revert to its initial state, ready to begin a new conversion cycle once the reset is released.
   - Processing the conversion starts precisely when the reset signal is released, ensuring no conversion occurs during the reset state.

4. **Serial Processing**:
   - The machine must handle an indefinite series of bits, thus requiring a mechanism capable of processing numbers of arbitrary lengths.

5. **Module Interface**:
   - Define an interface for the top-level Verilog module named `top_module`, with inputs and outputs properly configured. The inputs include the clock signal, asynchronous reset, and the serial bit input. There should be a single output for the processed 2's complement bit.

Given this context, detail the design and operational strategy for the Verilog module implementing such a Moore state machine, ensuring the descriptions are thorough enough to provide a foundation for starting the module coding process. Your task is to focus on the conceptual and structural aspects needed to meet all the specified behavioral requirements.
