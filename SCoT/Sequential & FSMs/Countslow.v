The task is to design a digital circuit module, specifically a synchronous decade counter, that cycles through the numbers 0 to 9 before repeating. The counter will operate based on certain input signals and is intended to be implemented in hardware using a hardware description language, presumably Verilog given the context. 

The essential components and functionalities needed for this module are as follows:

1. **Inputs:**
   - `clk` (clock): This is the signal that drives the time-based behavior of the counter. The counter may increment on either the rising or falling edge of this clock signal.
   - `slowena` (slow enable): This input acts as a gating signal for the counter. When `slowena` is asserted (typically a logic high), the counter is allowed to increment on the next clock cycle. When `slowena` is deasserted (logic low), the counter should pause, maintaining its current value until `slowena` is reasserted.
   - `reset`: This is a synchronous input that will reset the counter to the initial value of 0 when asserted. 'Synchronous' means that this reset will take effect in accordance with the clock signal, ensuring that the reset only occurs at specific times determined by the clock.

2. **Output:**
   - `q`: This is a 4-bit output because it needs to count up to at least 9, which is within the 4-bit binary range from 0 to 15. This output represents the current count value of the counter and updates based on the clock, slowena, and reset signals.

3. **Operation:**
   - The counter should increment its value by 1 each time the clock signal triggers (on its designated edge, which you may define as the rising or falling edge typically) and the `slowena` input is high.
   - Upon reaching the maximum count value of 9, it should wrap around and reset to 0 on the next increment cycle, thereby making it a decade counter.
   - If `reset` is asserted, regardless of the current state of `slowena`, the output `q` should be set to 0. The reset action should be synchronous with the clock.

The task involves implementing logic within a Verilog module that effectively manages these conditions to produce the desired counting behavior. Youâ€™ll need to consider edge cases, such as simultaneous reset and slowena signals, and ensure that your counter adheres to the specified behaviors. Also, consider using appropriate Verilog constructs to capture the synchronous behavior of the system.
