The task at hand involves designing a digital module using a hardware description language (HDL), such as Verilog, to create eight D flip-flops (DFFs). Each of these flip-flops should have certain specific characteristics and behaviors as outlined below:

1. **D Flip-Flops (DFFs)**: You need to implement eight individual D flip-flops. These are basic sequential logic devices used to lock in data on their input when they receive a trigger, and they hold that data until the next trigger event.

2. **Positive Edge Triggered**: The DFFs should be configured to respond to the positive (rising) edge of the clock signal (`clk`). A rising edge indicates the transition of the clock signal from a low (0) to a high (1) state, which is the moment when the flip-flops should capture the input data.

3. **Active High Synchronous Reset**: Incorporate an active high synchronous reset mechanism. "Active high" implies that the reset operation is triggered when the reset signal is high (1), and "synchronous" indicates that this reset should only occur in accordance with the clock, specifically at the rising edge. When the reset is activated, all flip-flops should be reset simultaneously.

4. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The module takes a `clk` signal which serves as the clock input for timing functions.
   - A `reset` signal input that triggers the reset functionality.
   - An 8-bit data input (`d`) representing eight individual lines of data to be processed and stored by the D flip-flops.
   - An 8-bit output (`q`) which provides the stored data as processed by the D flip-flops. The output should reflect either the data latched upon the last positive clock edge or reset values if the reset conditions are met.

5. **Module Outline**: The Verilog code begins with a module declaration (`module top_module (...)`) containing the necessary ports, followed by the implementation of the logic required to fulfill the specifications mentioned above.

Your task is to insert appropriate Verilog constructs to achieve the described functionality within the existing module outline. Consider logic synthesis rules, signal declarations, and how flip-flops are typically instantiated and controlled in Verilog.
