The task involves designing the combinational logic part of a Moore state machine using one-hot encoding. You are provided with a state transition table that specifies the transitions between states based on a single input value, as well as the corresponding output for each state. The states are encoded as follows: state A as 4'b0001, state B as 4'b0010, state C as 4'b0100, and state D as 4'b1000. Your objective is to derive the logic equations for both the state transitions and the output, relying solely on this encoding scheme.

To clarify, the state transition table expresses the machine's behavior as follows:

- When in state A (encoded as 4'b0001) and the input is 0, the next state is A; if the input is 1, the next state is B. The output in state A is 0.
- When in state B (encoded as 4'b0010) and the input is 0, the next state transitions to C; if the input is 1, it remains in state B. The output in state B is 0.
- When in state C (encoded as 4'b0100) and the input is 0, the machine returns to state A; with input 1, it progresses to state D. The output in state C is 0.
- When in state D (encoded as 4'b1000) and the input is 0, the transition leads to state C; if the input is 1, it goes to state B. Importantly, the output in state D is 1.

The logic equations you need to derive should dictate how the machine transitions from one state to another based on the current state and input, as well as how it produces the correct output based on the present state. The hint provided suggests focusing on the in-edges of the state transition diagram, meaning you should analyze which earlier states transition into a given next state based on the received input. Note that the test environment expects you to handle non-one-hot inputs properly, implying the solution should be robust enough to address erroneous input encoding by focusing solely on legitimate state entries within the one-hot scheme.
