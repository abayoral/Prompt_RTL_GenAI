The task at hand involves developing a finite-state machine (FSM) that controls a timer based on a specific sequence detected in a serial data input. The timer commences its operation following the steps outlined below:

1. **Detection of Sequence**: The FSM must continuously monitor a serial data input for the occurrence of a specific binary pattern, namely "1101". Once this pattern is detected, it triggers the timer to start its process.

2. **Bit Shifting**: After the detection of the "1101" pattern, the FSM is required to enable a functionality, indicated by asserting the output signal `shift_ena`, for exactly four clock cycles. This action signifies the shifting in of four additional bits, which determines the duration for which the timer should delay.

3. **Counting Phase**: Following the bit-shifting phase, the FSM transitions to a state where it asserts an output signal named `counting`, indicating that it is in a waiting state for the counters to complete their counting operation. This state is maintained until an input signal named `done_counting` becomes high, signifying that the counting process has finished.

4. **Notification of Timer Completion**: Once the counting is completed, the FSM should assert another output signal called `done`, to notify the user that the timer has concluded its operation. At this point, the FSM must wait for user acknowledgment, denoted by the input signal `ack` becoming high, before it can reset.

5. **Reset and Restart**: Upon receiving the acknowledgment (`ack`), the FSM should reset itself and transition back to the initial state, ready to search for the next occurrence of the "1101" start sequence in the input data.

This implementation involves defining the various states and transitions of the FSM within a Verilog module. The primary task is to construct the logic that allows the FSM to progress through these stages, properly handling the serial data inputs, and managing the state transitions based on specified conditions and inputs like `done_counting` and `ack`. The FSM needs to be synchronized with the system clock (`clk`) and should also respond to the `reset` signal, which initializes the FSM to its starting state, ensuring readiness for detecting the sequence anew after each complete cycle.
