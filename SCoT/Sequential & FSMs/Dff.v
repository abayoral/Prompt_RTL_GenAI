You're tasked with designing a module for a digital circuit component known as a D flip-flop. The flip-flop involves sequential logic, meaning it operates based on a clock signal. Your goal is to implement the functionality within a Verilog module named `top_module`. To achieve this, you will incorporate various elements as outlined below:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - You will define two inputs within your module: `clk` and `d`. The `clk` input represents the clock signal, which will determine when the flip-flop updates its state. The `d` input is the data signal that the flip-flop will store.
   - There will be one output, `q`, which should be declared as a register (`reg`). The output `q` will hold the stored value of the flip-flop, effectively mirroring the input `d` at specific moments dictated by the clock signal.

2. **Clocked Behavior**:
   - An essential feature of the D flip-flop is its ability to update its stored value on the rising or positive edge of the clock signal. This characteristic defines the sequential timing operation of the flip-flop.

3. **Always Block**:
   - Within the module, you will employ a clocked always block, which should be configured to react to the positive edge of the `clk`. This resembles triggering a response or action precisely when the clock signal transitions from a low state to a high state.
   - Within this always block, you will use non-blocking assignments to update the output `q`. Non-blocking assignments (`<=`) are ideal for ensuring that the behavior of sequential elements, such as flip-flops, remains predictable and intended simulations of clocked circuits.

As you construct this module, keep in mind that your main aim is effectively to replicate the behavior of a single D flip-flop using the provided template and instructions.
