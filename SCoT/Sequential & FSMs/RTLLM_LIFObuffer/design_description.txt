As a professional Verilog designer, you're tasked with implementing a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer module for temporary data storage designed in hardware description language, specifically Verilog. This buffer, used to manage temporary storage, is structured to handle 4-bit data entries and can hold a maximum of 4 entries, allowing for efficient push and pop operations determined by the read/write control signals provided.

The module you need to create should have the following specifications and features:

**Module Name:**
- LIFObuffer - This is the identifier for the module you will define, representing the LIFO buffer functionality.

**Input Ports:**
- `dataIn [3:0]`: A 4-bit wide input port that serves as the source of data to be pushed onto the buffer during write operations.
- `RW`: A control signal where '0' indicates a write operation is desired, and '1' indicates a read operation should be executed.
- `EN`: An enable signal that allows buffer operations to proceed when asserted (i.e., logic high).
- `Rst`: An active high reset signal used to clear and initialize the buffer, effectively resetting it.
- `Clk`: The clock signal that drives synchronous operations within the buffer module, triggering actions on its rising edge.

**Output Ports:**
- `EMPTY`: A flag that signals when the buffer is empty, preventing further read operations until data is available.
- `FULL`: A flag that indicates when the buffer has reached its capacity, stopping additional write operations from proceeding.
- `dataOut [3:0]`: A 4-bit wide output port through which data is retrieved during pop (read) operations from the buffer.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Stack Memory (stack_mem):** The buffer employs a memory array that behaves like a stack, facilitating Last-In-First-Out data handling. Each location in this array can store one of the 4-bit entries.
- **Stack Pointer (SP):** This pointer keeps track of the current position within the stack, helping manage which data will be read or written next.
- **Operational Logic:**
  - On the rising edge of `Clk`, and if `EN` is high, the module becomes active and proceeds with operations.
  - If `Rst` is high, the memory stack is cleared of all data, the stack pointer (`SP`) is reset to indicate the stack is empty (often set to an initial position such as 4, which is out of range for an empty stack), and all memory locations are reset to zeroes.
  - If `Rst` is not asserted (low) and the enable (`EN`) signal is active:
    - **For Write Operations** (`RW` is low): Provided the buffer is not full, data from `dataIn` is pushed onto the stack. This involves storing the data in the current stack pointer position and then decrementing the stack pointer to reflect the new top of stack position.
    - **For Read Operations** (`RW` is high): If the buffer is not empty, the topmost data is processed—popped from the stack—and outputted through `dataOut`. After reading, the corresponding memory location in the stack is cleared, and the stack pointer is incremented to shift the top of stack downwards.
  - The `EMPTY` and `FULL` output flags are continuously updated to reflect the stack pointer position, signaling the buffer's readiness to perform further operations. 

Please provide the complete code implementation for such a buffer, taking into consideration these specifications and ensuring the Verilog syntax and logic align with the described functionality.
