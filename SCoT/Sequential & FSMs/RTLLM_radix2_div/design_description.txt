As a professional Verilog designer, your task is to develop a module named `radix2_div` that implements a simplified radix-2 division algorithm suitable for processing 8-bit signed or unsigned integers. When outlining the module and its operation, consider the following specifications and requirements:

**Module Purpose and Functionality**
The module performs division operations on 8-bit operands, provided as the dividend and divisor, and outputs a 16-bit result comprising the quotient and the remainder. This module is expected to handle both signed and unsigned division operations, determined by an input signal.

**Inputs Description**
- `clk`: This is the clock signal that governs the synchronous operation of the module, ensuring that inputs and outputs are processed in alignment with clock cycles.
- `rst`: A reset signal that, when activated, initializes or resets the module’s state, ensuring a consistent starting point for operations.
- `sign`: A 1-bit signal that indicates whether the division operation is signed (when `sign` is set to 1) or unsigned (when `sign` is set to 0), affecting how the division computation is carried out.
- `dividend`: An 8-bit input signal that represents the dividend, the number to be divided in the operation.
- `divisor`: An 8-bit input signal representing the divisor, the number by which the dividend is to be divided.
- `opn_valid`: A control signal indicating that a valid division operation request is present, prompting the module to capture the input values and initiate processing.

**Outputs Description**
- `res_valid`: A 1-bit output signal that indicates to outside logic that the result is available and valid for use. This signal must be precisely managed to align with the finalization of the computation process.
- `result`: A 16-bit output where the upper 8 bits represent the remainder and the lower 8 bits represent the quotient of the division operation, encapsulating the full result of the division process.

**Operational Steps and Logic Implementation**
1. **Operation Start:** The module begins working when `opn_valid` is high and `res_valid` is low, signaling there is a fresh input to be processed. It ensures that the dividend and divisor inputs are captured and initializes necessary state variables.
   
2. **Initialization:** 
   - The module initializes a shift register (SR) with the absolute value of the dividend, shifted left by one bit, to prepare for sequential subtraction needed in division.
   - It also calculates and stores `NEG_DIVISOR`, which is the negation of the absolute divisor value, necessary for subtraction in two’s complement form.
   - Counter variables `cnt` and `start_cnt` are set to specific initial values to manage the sequence of division operations.

3. **Division Process:** When `start_cnt` is high, the module engages in iterative processing steps:
   - If the counter `cnt` reaches the value of 8, indicating that 8 subtraction steps have been completed, the division is complete. At this point, the counter and the start condition are reset, and `SR` is updated to produce the final remainder and quotient.
   - If not complete, the module increments the counter and executes subtraction of `NEG_DIVISOR` from the current SR value, managing intermediate results using a multiplexer to select the appropriate value based on the subtraction's carry-out.
   - The SR is continually updated by performing a left shift and inserting the carry-out from the subtraction at an appropriate position, driving the bit-serial division process.

4. **Result Validity Management:** The `res_valid` output is carefully controlled based on the system’s reset state, the current counter condition, and whether the result data has been utilized, ensuring that res_valid only signals 'high' when results are ready for external use and consistently managed throughout module operation.

Through these outlined steps, a complete and functional Verilog design for the `radix2_div` module will achieve the desired division functionality, adhering to the specified requirements and constraints.
