In designing a digital system using Verilog, you are tasked with creating a module named `top_module` that processes an 8-bit input vector signal, `in`, over successive clock cycles. This module needs to identify changes, known as 'edges,' for each bit within this vector. An 'edge' is defined as a transition in the signal from either low (0) to high (1) or high (1) to low (0). However, the focus of this task is specifically detecting the 'rising edge,' which occurs when a bit changes from 0 to 1 between two consecutive clock cycles.

The module should be implemented with the following specifications:

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: A clock signal that synchronizes the operation of the module, providing the timing reference for detecting transitions.
  - `in`: An 8-bit vector representing the current state of the input signals to be monitored for transitions on each of its bits.

- **Output:**
  - `anyedge`: An 8-bit vector where each bit corresponds to the respective bit in the input vector `in`. This output should be set (e.g., to 1) during the clock cycle immediately following the detection of a 0 to 1 transition in the corresponding input bit.

Some key points and considerations for implementing your solution:
- The module should continuously monitor the 8-bit input signal, `in`, on each positive edge of `clk` to determine if any of the bits have experienced a 0 to 1 transition.
- For each bit in `in`, if a rising edge is detected, the corresponding bit in `anyedge` should be set during the next clock cycle, indicating that a transition has occurred.
- The logic should accurately track and update the detection status from one clock cycle to the next, ensuring that each detected transition is captured and signaled exactly once.

Consider how you will store the previous states of `in` to compare with the current states for edge detection, and how to maintain the correct output response in `anyedge`. The implementation should effectively handle simultaneous transitions on multiple bits and be able to reset or continue detection for subsequent cycles.
