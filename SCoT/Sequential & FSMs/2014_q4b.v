The scenario described in the problem involves creating a top-level hardware design module using Verilog, a hardware description language, for the purpose of implementing a shift register on the DE2 board. The task specifies the creation of a `top_module`, which is a container that will organize necessary components and connections to perform the desired operations. The design requires the use of four instances of a subcircuit named `MUXDFF` within this module.

Key details of this task involve:

1. **Shift Register Details**: You will be implementing a shift register with a parameter `n` set to `4`. This suggests that the shift register will include four stages, meaning data is stored and shifted across four serialized registers.

2. **Instantiation Requirement**: You will need to instantiate four copies of the `MUXDFF` module within your `top_module`. The `MUXDFF` module should be defined as a separate entity or subcircuit with specific functionality that integrates into the larger system.

3. **Board-Specific Connections**: This design is geared towards being implemented on a physical hardware board known as the DE2 board. Particular connections to this hardware are specified:
   - The `R` inputs of the shift register must connect to the board’s switches labeled `SW`.
   - The `clk` (clock signal) should be tied to `KEY[0]`.
   - The enable signal `E` is associated with `KEY[1]`.
   - A load signal `L` corresponds to `KEY[2]`.
   - The input data wire `w` is linked to `KEY[3]`.

4. **Output Specifications**: The resulting output from this shift register, presumably reflecting the state of each stage of the register, should be connected and displayed on the red lights, labeled `LEDR[3:0]`, indicating that each LED represents the corresponding bit in the register’s output.

To complete the task, begin by drafting the structure of the `top_module` using the given input and output connections, then proceed to create the `MUXDFF` subcircuit with inputs and outputs as dictated by the specific operational requirements of the shift register. Ensure that each module's ports are clearly defined and correctly connected according to the outlined hardware interface of the DE2 board.
