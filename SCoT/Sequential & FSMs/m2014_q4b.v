The task is to design and implement a digital circuit component called a D flip-flop with an additional feature of asynchronous reset, using Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). In this description:

- "D flip-flop" refers to a type of digital storage element that captures the value of the 'd' input at the moment of a clock edge and maintains (or 'stores') this value until the next clock edge, under the control of the 'clk' signal.
  
- The 'clk' input represents the clock signal, which is a timing reference used to synchronize state transitions. The D flip-flop should capture the value of 'd' on a specific edge (rising or falling) of this clock signal.

- The 'd' input is the data or signal that will be stored in the flip-flop upon the appropriate clock edge.

- 'ar' represents the asynchronous reset. This signal is used to instantly reset the output 'q' to a predetermined state (commonly logic 0) irrespective of the clock signal when it is active. This reset does not wait for the clock edge, meaning it overrides normal operation to reset the output immediately when asserted.

- The output 'q' is the stored value. It reflects the last captured value of 'd', unless overridden by the asynchronous reset.

The task involves filling in the logic within the 'top_module' where you will write the Verilog code that properly implements these operational requirements. Consider how the asynchronous reset interacts with the clock-evolved behavior typical of sequential elements like flip-flops.
