As a professional Verilog designer, you are tasked with implementing a Verilog module that functions as an 8-bit multiplier using the method of shift-and-add operations. Here are the specifics and details of what you are to accomplish:

**Module Name:**
- The designated name for your module is `multi_8bit`.

**Input Ports:**
- `A [7:0]`: This represents the first operand of the multiplication operation, an 8-bit wide input serving as the multiplicand.
- `B [7:0]`: This is the second operand, also 8 bits wide, functioning as the multiplier in the multiplication process.

**Output Port:**
- `product [15:0]`: This output is 16 bits wide to successfully accommodate the full range of possible values resulting from the multiplication of the two 8-bit inputs. It represents the final computed product of inputs A and B.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Multiplication Process**: You are required to implement an algorithm that performs multiplication of the two input values, A and B, utilizing a shift-and-add method. This involves iterating over each bit of the multiplier, B.
  - For every bit in B that is set to 1, an addition operation is executed whereby the multiplicand, A, is added to an intermediate product. This addition is executed at the corresponding bit position, determined by the current iteration.

- **Shifting Operation**: Concurrently, after each addition operation, the multiplicand A undergoes a logical left shift by one bit position. This shift mimics the foundational process used in binary multiplication to adjust the position for the next potential addition step adequately.

- The design requires careful consideration to ensure that the iteration over bits accounts accurately for the shift distance, and each addition takes place with correctly aligned values. The completed product will ultimately be stored in the output port, `product`.

Understanding the task, your goal is to create a Verilog module that encapsulates this behavior, appropriately handling the shift-and-add logic to derive the product of two 8-bit binary numbers.
