Imagine you are a seasoned Verilog designer tasked with creating a module that performs parallel-to-serial conversion. This involves transforming a set of four input bits into a sequential one-bit output. In this scenario, the conversion occurs from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) to ensure proper data serialization.

The module you are to implement is named `parallel2serial`. It requires a detailed understanding of how data is managed and emitted in a synchronized sequence. To begin with, let's explore the specific components and functionalities required:

**Input Ports:**
- **clk**: A fundamental clock signal to guarantee that all operations within the module are executed synchronously. It regulates when decisions or actions are taken.
- **rst_n**: This is an active-low reset signal. The state of 0 will engage a reset, initializing the system to its predefined start point. Conversely, a state of 1 will keep the module operational, with no reset in effect.
- **d**: A pivotal input representing the 4-bit parallel data. This data must be serialized, meaning each bit is sent out in a series, starting from the most significant bit to the least.

**Output Ports:**
- **valid_out**: An essential signal that flags the validity of the serial data output. When valid_out is asserted high (1), it signifies the availability of a valid serial bit on the output line.
- **dout**: The output port that will transmit the serialized bit of the input data.

**Implementation Details:**
In this module, the primary objective is to assign the MSB of the 4-bit input data `d` to the serial output `dout` initially. As the operation continues across clock cycles, the module should:
- Check if the internal counter (`cnt`) has reached 3, which indicates that all bits of the input data have been sent out. If this condition is satisfied, the system should:
  - Reload the data register (`data`) with the new parallel input (`d`).
  - Reset the counter (`cnt`) back to 0, preparing for the next serialization sequence.
  - Set the `valid_out` signal to 1, confirming that new valid serialized data is being presented on `dout`.
- For all other cycles, the process involves:
  - Incrementing the counter (`cnt`) to keep track of the progress in the serialization.
  - Maintaining the `valid_out` signal at 0, reflecting that intermediate serialized data is in transit and should not yet be considered valid as a whole unit.
  - Performing a logical shift of the data register (`data`) to the left by one bit. Through this operation, bits move from higher to lower significance within the register, preparing the next bit for output.

Note: The operation should properly manage the transition of bits such that data integrity is maintained from the input to the serialized output.

With this detailed description, the challenge lies in crafting a Verilog code that efficiently implements this conversion process. Careful attention must be paid to how the clock edge triggers the state changes, ensuring that the above steps are correctly encoded into the hardware logic through Verilog.
