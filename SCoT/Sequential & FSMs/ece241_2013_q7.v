You have been given the task of designing a JK flip-flop circuit based on its truth table, using a D-type flip-flop and some logic gates. The truth table for the JK flip-flop is as follows:

- When both inputs J and K are 0, the output Q will remain the same as its previous value Qold, indicating no change.
- When J is 0 and K is 1, the output Q should reset to 0.
- When J is 1 and K is 0, the output Q should set to 1.
- When both inputs J and K are 1, the output Q should toggle from its previous state Qold to its complement, noted as ~Qold.

Your task is to translate this behavior, described by the truth table, into a working digital logic circuit using only a D-type flip-flop and some basic logic gates. The D flip-flop will serve as the primary storage element, capturing the desired Q output on a positive clock edge based on the logic derived from the JK inputs. 

A D-type flip-flop typically has an input D, a clock input, and outputs Q and Q', where Q' is complementary to Q. Your challenge involves designing a combinational logic network involving these inputs and additional logic gates (such as AND, OR, NOT) to control the D input of the D-type flip-flop in such a way that it exhibits the behavior specified in the JK flip-flop truth table.

Within the given module `top_module`, you need to write the necessary implementation that allows the output Q to behave according to the JK flip-flop properties under clock influence, assuming that the clock is triggered by positive edges. Ensure you consider the initial value (Qold) held by the D flip-flop before any clock edge occurs when implementing your solution.
