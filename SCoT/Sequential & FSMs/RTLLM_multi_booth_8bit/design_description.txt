Imagine you are a seasoned professional in Verilog design, tasked with implementing a specific Verilog module. The module in question, named `multi_booth_8bit`, is an 8-bit Radix-4 Booth multiplier. It is designed to handle the multiplication of two 8-bit binary numbers, `a` and `b`, by employing the Booth multiplication algorithm. This implementation requires synthesizing logic that can efficiently execute the Booth algorithm for multiplication within a digital system.

1. **Module Purpose**: The module aims to produce the 16-bit product of two 8-bit input values. It also includes a mechanism to indicate when the multiplication process is complete.

2. **Inputs and Outputs**: 
    - **Input Ports**:
        - `clk`: This clock signal governs the timing of the module's operations, ensuring that they occur at the correct intervals within a clock cycle. 
        - `reset`: A reset signal used to initialize or reset the state of the module, clearing any pre-existing data and setting the module to start a new multiplication process.
        - `a`: An 8-bit input representing the multiplicand, one of the two numbers to be multiplied.
        - `b`: Another 8-bit input standing as the multiplier.
    - **Output Ports**:
        - `p`: This is a 16-bit output representing the final product of the multiplication. The width of this output reflects the maximum possible size of the result when multiplying two 8-bit numbers.
        - `rdy`: A ready signal that acts as a flag indicating the completion of the multiplication operation. When set to high, it signifies that the product `p` is ready for use or further processing.

3. **Operational Details**: 
    - Upon the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), or during the positive edge of the reset (`reset`), the module will manage internal operations as follows:
    - **Reset Behavior**: Should the reset be high during a clock cycle, the module initializes two 16-bit registers. The `multiplier` register is set with the value of the multiplicand extended to 16 bits by sign-extending `a`, and the `multiplicand` register holds the multiplier extended similarly with `b`.
    - **Normal Operation**: When not resetting, and if the `ctr`, a 5-bit counter, is less than 16, indicating that the multiplication has not yet been completed, the module shifts the `multiplicand` one bit to the left. This shifting is part of the Booth algorithm, crucial for implementing the operation correctly.
    - The Booth encoding further involves checking each bit of the `multiplier`. If `multiplier[ctr]` reads as 1, it signifies a need to perform an accumulation of the `multiplicand` into the product register `p`.
    - The counter `ctr` is incremented with each cycle until it reaches 16. Reaching this count means the multiplication process is complete, and the `rdy` signal is then asserted high, signaling readiness of the output product.

The design is intended to showcase your capabilities and understanding of both Verilog and the Booth algorithm particularly in the context of digital logic design for multipliers, using clock and reset signals with state-driven processes.
