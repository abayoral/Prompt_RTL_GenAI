The task at hand is to design and implement a digital circuit using Verilog that can function both as a four-bit shift register and as a down counter. The circuit is encapsulated within a module named `top_module`, which will have specific inputs and outputs described below.

### Inputs and Their Functions:

1. **clk**: This is the clock signal input, which serves to synchronize and trigger events within the circuit at each clock cycle's rising edge or falling edge, depending on your design choice.

2. **shift_ena**: This is a control signal input that, when set to logical high ('1'), enables the shifting operation within the shift register. The data is shifted into the register starting with the most significant bit (MSB) first. The data to be shifted in is provided by the `data` input.

3. **count_ena**: This is another control signal input that enables the down counting operation. When this is set to logical high ('1'), the number currently stored in the shift register decrements by one.

4. **data**: This input provides the new bit to be shifted into the register when the shifting operation is enabled by `shift_ena`. This data should be considered only when shift operation is active.

### Output:

- **q [3:0]**: This is a 4-bit wide output vector representing the current state of the shift register. This output will reflect the result of either the shift operation or the decrement operation, based on the control signal inputs.

### Operational Conditions:

- The module should implement a mechanism to handle two main operations: shifting data and decrementing the register's current value.
  
- **Shift Operation**: When `shift_ena` is activated and `count_ena` is not, the shift register should take the `data` input and shift all stored bits to the right, inserting the `data` bit at the most significant position.

- **Count Operation**: When `count_ena` is activated and `shift_ena` is not, the contents of the shift register should decrement by one. This operation treats the register's current content as a binary number.

- **Simultaneous Activation**: In the scenario where both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are high, it is stated that the behavior of the system is unspecified. This implies that the module does not need to prioritize one operation over the other in such cases, and the behavior can be left undefined.

Please note, when implementing the logic within the `top_module`, focus on properly capturing and handling these conditions to ensure the shift register functions accurately as both a shift register and a down counter under the specified conditions. Your choice of clock edge, logic synthesis, and state maintenance will be critical in ensuring the correct functionality of this module adaptable to different operational requirements defined by `shift_ena` and `count_ena` inputs.
