In this task, you are required to design a digital circuit using Verilog, a hardware description language. Specifically, you are to implement eight D-type flip-flops, often referred to as DFFs, within a module called `top_module`. Each flip-flop must be set up such that it is triggered by the rising edge, also known as the positive edge, of a clock signal labeled `clk`. 

You'll be provided with an 8-bit wide input signal `d`, representing a set of data bits, from which each bit will be fed into a separate D flip-flop. The output `q` should also be 8 bits wide, where each bit corresponds to the stored value from each D flip-flop after being triggered by a clock event. The task is to write the appropriate Verilog code within the provided module structure that achieves this setup. 

Ensure that the D flip-flops are correctly configured to sample the input signal `d` and update the output signal `q` with the stable data value on the rising edge of the clock. Consider how you would declare and instantiate each flip-flop, and how you would ensure they are all synchronized using the same clock signal.
