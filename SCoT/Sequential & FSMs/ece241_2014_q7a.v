The task at hand is to design an electronic circuit module for a counter that counts from 1 to 12 using a synchronous digital system with specific inputs and outputs. Let me help clarify and detail this requirement for further understanding:

1. **Objective:** 
   - You are required to implement a 1 to 12 counter using available components, consisting primarily of a provided 4-bit binary counter module and basic logic gates.

2. **Inputs to Your Module:**
   - **`clk:`** This signal serves as the clock input, triggering actions in the circuit on its positive edge.
   - **`reset:`** This is an active-high synchronous reset input. When asserted (high), it should reset the counter immediately to 1, overriding any other operations.
   - **`enable:`** When this input is set high, the counter should be allowed to count. If low, the counter should maintain its current state.

3. **Outputs from Your Module:**
   - **`Q[3:0]:`** This 4-bit output represents the current count value of the counter, effectively showing the numbers from 1 to 12.
   - **`c_enable:`** This serves as the enable signal for the internal counter component, allowing external verification that the counter is correctly enabled or disabled as required.
   - **`c_load:`** This is the load signal that, when triggered, inputs specific data into the internal counter synchronously, with priority over counting.
   - **`c_d[3:0]:`** Represents the data inputs to the internal counter, specifying what the internal counter should be loaded with when `c_load` is active.

4. **Available Components:**
   - **`count4:`** A pre-designed 4-bit binary counter module which includes `enable` and a higher priority `load` input. The module should be instantiated within your design.
   - **Logic Gates:** Use these for any necessary signal manipulation or logic operations within the module.

5. **Design Constraints:**
   - **Counter Range:** The counter should sequence through the numbers 1 to 12 and wrap back to 1 after reaching 12.
   - **Signal Assignments:** Accurate assignment of `c_enable`, `c_load`, and `c_d` is critical for correct operation and external validation.

6. **Component Instantiation:**
   - Within your top-level module, instantiate the given `count4` component and connect its inputs and outputs to achieve the desired counting behavior.

Consider the synchronization needs (using the clock signal) and prioritize the reset logic to ensure that `reset` immediately brings the counter back to the starting value of 1 regardless of other settings. Make sure to utilize logic gates as necessary to handle transitions and conditions within the stated counting range.
