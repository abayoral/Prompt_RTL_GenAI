Based on the chain of thought provided:

1. Understand Inputs and Outputs:
   - Inputs: `ring`, `vibrate_mode`
   - Outputs: `ringer`, `motor`

2. Define Logic:
   - When `ring` is high:
     - If `vibrate_mode` is high, `motor` should be high and `ringer` should be low.
     - If `vibrate_mode` is low, `ringer` should be high and `motor` should be low.
   - When `ring` is low, both `ringer` and `motor` should be low.

3. Implement the logic using `assign` statements.

Let's proceed to write the Verilog code for this.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire ring,
    input wire vibrate_mode,
    output wire ringer,
    output wire motor
);
    // Control logic for motor and ringer
    assign motor = ring && vibrate_mode;
    assign ringer = ring && ~vibrate_mode;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- `assign motor = ring && vibrate_mode;`
  - The `motor` is turned on if there is an incoming call (`ring` is high) and the phone is in vibrate mode (`vibrate_mode` is high).

- `assign ringer = ring && ~vibrate_mode;`
  - The `ringer` is turned on if there is an incoming call (`ring` is high) and the phone is not in vibrate mode (`vibrate_mode` is low).

This ensures that only one of the `motor` or `ringer` is active at any given time based on the value of `vibrate_mode`. If `ring` is low, both outputs will be low.
