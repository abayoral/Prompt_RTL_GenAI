Given the requirements and the chain of thought, the conceptual design involves creating a 32-bit adder-subtractor module that uses two 16-bit adder modules and XOR gates to conditionally invert the `b` input based on the `sub` signal. Below is the implementation in Verilog:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [31:0] a,
    input wire [31:0] b,
    input wire sub,
    output wire [31:0] sum
);

    wire [31:0] b_invert;
    wire carry;
    wire [15:0] sum_low, sum_high;

    // XOR the b input with the sub to create b_invert
    assign b_invert = b ^ {32{sub}};

    // Instantiate the lower 16-bit adder
    add16 lower_adder (
        .a(a[15:0]),
        .b(b_invert[15:0]),
        .cin(sub),
        .sum(sum_low),
        .carry(carry)
    );

    // Instantiate the higher 16-bit adder
    add16 higher_adder (
        .a(a[31:16]),
        .b(b_invert[31:16]),
        .cin(carry),
        .sum(sum_high)
    );

    // Combine the results
    assign sum = {sum_high, sum_low};

endmodule

// 16-bit adder module definition
module add16 (
    input wire [15:0] a,
    input wire [15:0] b,
    input wire cin,
    output wire [15:0] sum,
    output wire carry
);
    assign {carry, sum} = a + b + cin;
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - `a` and `b` are 32-bit inputs.
   - `sub` is a single-bit input that controls whether we perform addition or subtraction.
   - `sum` is the 32-bit output representing the result of the adder-subtractor operation.

2. **Intermediate Signals:**
   - `b_invert` is derived by XORing each bit of `b` with `sub`. This will invert `b` if `sub` is `1`, otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
   - `carry` is used to connect the carry-out of the lower 16-bit adder to the carry-in of the higher 16-bit adder.
   - `sum_low` and `sum_high` store the results from the lower and higher 16-bit adders, respectively.

3. **Module Structuring:**
   - The lower 16-bit adder instance computes the sum of the lower 16 bits of `a` and `b_invert`, with `sub` as the carry-in.
   - The higher 16-bit adder instance computes the sum of the higher 16 bits of `a` and `b_invert`, using the carry-out from the lower adder as its carry-in.
   - The final 32-bit sum is formed by concatenating the results of the higher and lower 16-bit adders.

This structure ensures that the `b` input is conditionally inverted based on the `sub` signal, and the combined carries from the two adder instances correctly perform the addition or subtraction operation.
