Based on the chain of thought provided, here's the Verilog code for a combinational circuit with 100 inputs and three specific outputs: out_and, out_or, and out_xor. Each output is the result of applying a corresponding bitwise reduction operation on the 100 input bits.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [99:0] in,
    output wire out_and,
    output wire out_or,
    output wire out_xor
);
    // AND reduction operator for out_and
    assign out_and = &in;
    
    // OR reduction operator for out_or
    assign out_or = |in;
    
    // XOR reduction operator for out_xor
    assign out_xor = ^in;
    
endmodule
```

Explanation:
1. The module `top_module` has a single 100-bit wide input `in` and three single-bit outputs: `out_and`, `out_or`, and `out_xor`.
2. The `assign` statement uses the reduction operators directly on the 100-bit input `in` to compute the outputs:
    - `&in` computes the AND of all 100 bits.
    - `|in` computes the OR of all 100 bits.
    - `^in` computes the XOR of all 100 bits.

This implementation takes full advantage of the reduction operators in Verilog to simplify the logic and keep it concise.
