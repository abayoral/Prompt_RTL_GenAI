Based on the chain of thought outlined, we can now write the logic equations for the next state and the output:

1. **Next State Logic:**

   - For state `A` (4'b0001):
     - `next_state[A] = (state[A] && (in == 0)) || (state[C] && (in == 0));`

   - For state `B` (4'b0010):
     - `next_state[B] = (state[A] && (in == 1)) || (state[D] && (in == 1));`

   - For state `C` (4'b0100):
     - `next_state[C] = (state[B] && (in == 0)) || (state[D] && (in == 0));`

   - For state `D` (4'b1000):
     - `next_state[D] = (state[C] && (in == 1));`

2. **Output Logic:**

   - `out = state[D]; // The output is 1 if the current state is `D`, otherwise it is 0.`

Here is the specific assignment logic in pseudo code format:

### Assignments for Next State Logic

- **For State A:**
  ```pseudo
  next_state[A] = (state[A] && (in == 0)) || (state[C] && (in == 0));
  ```

- **For State B:**
  ```pseudo
  next_state[B] = (state[A] && (in == 1)) || (state[D] && (in == 1));
  ```

- **For State C:**
  ```pseudo
  next_state[C] = (state[B] && (in == 0)) || (state[D] && (in == 0));
  ```

- **For State D:**
  ```pseudo
  next_state[D] = (state[C] && (in == 1));
  ```

### Assignment for Output Logic

```pseudo
out = state[D];
```

Now that we have these logical assignments ready, they can be converted into Verilog syntax and incorporated into a Verilog module.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire in,
    input wire [3:0] state, // One-hot encoded current state
    output wire [3:0] next_state, // One-hot encoded next state
    output wire out // Output based on current state
);
    // Next state logic based on the given state transition table
    assign next_state[0] = (state[0] && (in == 0)) || (state[2] && (in == 0)); // next_state[A]
    assign next_state[1] = (state[0] && (in == 1)) || (state[3] && (in == 1)); // next_state[B]
    assign next_state[2] = (state[1] && (in == 0)) || (state[3] && (in == 0)); // next_state[C]
    assign next_state[3] = (state[2] && (in == 1)); // next_state[D]

    // Output logic: out is 1 if the current state is D, otherwise 0
    assign out = state[3];

endmodule
```

This completes the Verilog code for a Moore state machine based on the given state transition table. This module defines the next state and output based on the current state and input.
