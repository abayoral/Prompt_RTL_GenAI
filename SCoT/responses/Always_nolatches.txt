Based on the provided detailed steps and understanding of the problem requirements, the Verilog module to recognize PS/2 keyboard arrow key scancodes can be structured as follows:

### Solving Process Translated into Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up
);

    // Combinational logic to detect arrow keys based on scancode
    always @(*) begin
        // Initialize all outputs to 0
        left = 0;
        down = 0;
        right = 0;
        up = 0;

        // Check the scancode and set the appropriate output to 1
        case (scancode)
            16'he06b: left = 1;  // Left arrow
            16'he072: down = 1;  // Down arrow
            16'he074: right = 1; // Right arrow
            16'he075: up = 1;    // Up arrow
            default: ;           // For any other scancode, all outputs remain 0
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Module Declaration:**
    - The module is named `top_module`.
    - It has one 16-bit input (`scancode`).
    - It has four 1-bit outputs (`left`, `down`, `right`, and `up`), all of which are declared as `reg` because they will be assigned values within an `always` block.

2. **Initialization and Case Statement:**
    - An `always @(*)` block ensures that the logic is combinational, meaning it will update outputs whenever the input (`scancode`) changes.
    - Inside the `always` block, all outputs (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) are initially set to `0` to prevent unintended values (avoiding latches).
    - A `case` statement checks the value of `scancode`:
        - If `scancode` matches `16'he06b`, the `left` output is set to `1`.
        - If `scancode` matches `16'he072`, the `down` output is set to `1`.
        - If `scancode` matches `16'he074`, the `right` output is set to `1`.
        - If `scancode` matches `16'he075`, the `up` output is set to `1`.
        - For any other value of `scancode`, the default block ensures that no change is made since all outputs are already initialized to `0`.

This Verilog code efficiently detects which arrow key has been pressed based on the provided scancode and sets the corresponding output signal.
