To tackle the task as described, let’s break it down step-by-step:

1. Understand the Requirements:
    - Use the provided `my_dff8` module, which is an 8-bit D flip-flop, and instantiate three such modules.
    - Chain these modules to create a shift register with a length of 3.
    - Implement a 4-to-1 multiplexer to select the output based on the `sel` input.
    - The `sel` input will determine the delay in clock cycles (from 0 to 3) for the input data `d`.

2. Determine the Inputs and Outputs:
    - Inputs: `clk` (clock), `d` (8-bit data input), `sel` (2-bit selection input).
    - Output: `q` (8-bit data output).

3. Define Intermediate Signals:
    - Intermediate signals to hold the outputs of each `my_dff8` instance.

4. Structuring the Module:
    - Start with the necessary module declarations and specify the inputs and outputs.
    - Instantiate three `my_dff8` modules, connecting the input of each to the output of the previous module to form a shift register.
    - Set up a multiplexer using an always block with a case statement to select the appropriate output based on `sel`.

Here’s the Verilog code for the described module:

```verilog
module my_dff8 (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end
endmodule

module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] d,
    input wire [1:0] sel,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    // Intermediate signals to hold the outputs of each my_dff8 instance
    wire [7:0] q0, q1, q2;

    // Instantiate three my_dff8 modules
    my_dff8 dff0 (.clk(clk), .d(d), .q(q0));
    my_dff8 dff1 (.clk(clk), .d(q0), .q(q1));
    my_dff8 dff2 (.clk(clk), .d(q1), .q(q2));

    // Multiplexer to select the output based on sel
    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            2'b00: q = d;   // No delay
            2'b01: q = q0;  // 1 clock cycle delay
            2'b10: q = q1;  // 2 clock cycle delay
            2'b11: q = q2;  // 3 clock cycle delay
            default: q = 8'b0; // Default case (to handle any unforeseen conditions)
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Intermediate Signals:**
    - `q0`, `q1`, `q2` are the intermediate signals used to capture the output of each `my_dff8` instance.

- **my_dff8 Instances:**
    - The first `my_dff8` instance (`dff0`) takes `d` as input and provides `q0` as output.
    - The second `my_dff8` instance (`dff1`) takes `q0` as input and provides `q1` as output.
    - The third `my_dff8` instance (`dff2`) takes `q1` as input and provides `q2` as output.

- **Multiplexer Logic:**
    - The always block is triggered by any change in `sel`.
    - The case statement inside the block selects the appropriate output based on `sel`:
        - `00`: `q` is assigned the original input `d`.
        - `01`: `q` is assigned the output of the first D flip-flop (`q0`).
        - `10`: `q` is assigned the output of the second D flip-flop (`q1`).
        - `11`: `q` is assigned the output of the third D flip-flop (`q2`).

This module effectively creates a shift register using three `my_dff8` instances and includes a multiplexer to select the appropriate delayed output based on the `sel` input.
