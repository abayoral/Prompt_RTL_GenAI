Certainly! Let's translate the given requirements and the solving process into the Verilog module named "top_module". The module will implement the specified logic for `out_both`, `out_any`, and `out_different`.

Here is the Verilog code following the outlined process:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [99:0] in,
    output wire [98:0] out_both,
    output wire [98:0] out_any,
    output wire [99:0] out_different
);
    // out_both: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'
    assign out_both = in[99:1] & in[98:0];

    // out_any: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'
    assign out_any = in[99:1] | in[98:0];

    // out_different: Each bit of this output vector indicates whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left
    // Treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[99]â€™s left neighbour is in[0].
    assign out_different = in ^ {in[0], in[99:1]};
    
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **out_both**:
    - **Logic**: The vector `out_both` at index `i` ensures that both `in[i]` and `in[i-1]` are '1'. This can be achieved with a bitwise AND operation between `in[99:1]` and `in[98:0]`.

2. **out_any**:
    - **Logic**: The vector `out_any` at index `i` ensures that either `in[i]` or `in[i-1]` is '1'. This can be achieved with a bitwise OR operation between `in[99:1]` and `in[98:0]`.

3. **out_different**:
    - **Logic**: The vector `out_different` at index `i` ensures that `in[i]` is different from `in[i-1]`. This can be achieved with a bitwise XOR operation. For this vector to wrap around, we concatenate `in[0]` to the beginning of `in[99:1]` and perform the bitwise XOR with `in`.
    
This module implements the described behavior accurately with the provided input conditions.
