Based on the detailed solving process, the Verilog code for the 6-to-1 multiplexer is constructed as follows:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [2:0] sel,
    input wire [3:0] data0,
    input wire [3:0] data1,
    input wire [3:0] data2,
    input wire [3:0] data3,
    input wire [3:0] data4,
    input wire [3:0] data5,
    output reg [3:0] out
);

    // Multiplexer logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            3'b000: out = data0;
            3'b001: out = data1;
            3'b010: out = data2;
            3'b011: out = data3;
            3'b100: out = data4;
            3'b101: out = data5;
            default: out = 4'b0000; // Default case if sel is outside 0 to 5
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Module Declaration:** The module is named `top_module` with inputs `sel`, `data0`, `data1`, `data2`, `data3`, `data4`, `data5`, and an output `out`.
2. **Always Block:** An always block is used with sensitivity list `(*)` to handle combinational logic.
3. **Case Statement:** A case statement handles the selection of inputs based on the value of `sel`.
    - For values of `sel` from 0 to 5, the corresponding `data` input is assigned to the output `out`.
    - A default case is included to handle `sel` values outside the range 0 to 5, setting `out` to 0. This ensures that the output is always defined, avoiding inferred latches.

This approach ensures the multiplexer behavior is accurately modeled, selecting the appropriate 4-bit input based on the 3-bit `sel` control signal.
