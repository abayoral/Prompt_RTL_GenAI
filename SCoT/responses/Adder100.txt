Based on the detailed understanding and outlined steps, we can write the Verilog code for a 100-bit binary adder as follows:

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [99:0] a,
    input wire [99:0] b,
    input wire cin,
    output wire [99:0] sum,
    output wire cout
);
    // Internal signal to hold the complete result with carry-out
    wire [100:0] result;

    // Perform the addition with carry-in
    assign result = a + b + cin;

    // Extract the sum and carry-out from the result
    assign sum = result[99:0];
    assign cout = result[100];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - The module is named `top_module` and it has inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin`, and outputs `sum` and `cout`.

2. **Intermediate Signal:**
   - An internal wire `result` is declared as `[100:0]` to hold the sum of `a`, `b`, and `cin`, including the carry-out.

3. **Addition Operation:**
   - The addition operation \( \text{assign result = a + b + cin;} \) takes care of summing the 100-bit inputs `a` and `b` along with the carry-in `cin`.

4. **Extracting Outputs:**
   - The lower 100 bits of `result` are assigned to the `sum` output.
   - The most significant bit (the 101st bit) of `result` is assigned to the `cout` output.

This implementation directly uses the Verilog's capability to handle vector arithmetic, making it both elegant and efficient.
