Given the chain of thought, we can write the Verilog code for `top_module` that instantiates `mod_a` and properly connects its ports based on their positions.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire out1,
    output wire out2
);
    // Instance of mod_a with port mapping by position
    mod_a instance_name (
        .out1(out1), // 1st output of mod_a
        .out2(out2), // 2nd output of mod_a
        .in1(a),     // 1st input of mod_a
        .in2(b),     // 2nd input of mod_a
        .in3(c),     // 3rd input of mod_a
        .in4(d)      // 4th input of mod_a
    );
endmodule
```

With this code:
- The `top_module` takes four inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and produces two outputs (`out1`, `out2`).
- An instance of `mod_a` named `instance_name` is created.
- The positional ports of `mod_a` are connected as required:
  - The first output of `mod_a` is connected to `top_module`'s `out1`.
  - The second output of `mod_a` is connected to `top_module`'s `out2`.
  - The first input of `mod_a` is connected to `top_module`'s `a`.
  - The second input of `mod_a` is connected to `top_module`'s `b`.
  - The third input of `mod_a` is connected to `top_module`'s `c`.
  - The fourth input of `mod_a` is connected to `top_module`'s `d`.
