Based on your detailed chain of thought, we need to create a Verilog module that always drives its output (`one`) to logic high (`1`). The steps and logic provided are correct, and the implementation should be indeed straightforward.

Here is the Verilog code for the specified module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    output wire one
);
    // Assign logic high (1) to the output
    assign one = 1'b1;  // Using 1'b1 to explicitly denote 1 in binary format

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**:
    - The `top_module` is declared with one output (`one`).

2. **Logic Implementation**:
    - The `assign` statement sets the `one` output to a constant logic high value (`1`).

This simple module ensures that the output `one` is always driven to logic high (`1`).
