The chain of thought here helps us clearly understand the requirements and how to implement the intermediate signal to detect the changes. Let's proceed with the Verilog code for the given task.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] anyedge
);
    reg [7:0] prev_in;

    // Edge detection logic: Check for changes from 0 to 1 and update anyedge
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        anyedge <= in & ~prev_in;
        prev_in <= in;
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs Declaration**:
   - `clk`: Clock signal.
   - `in [7:0]`: 8-bit input signal.
   - `anyedge [7:0]`: 8-bit output signal indicating a rising edge detection.
   
2. **Intermediate Signal Declaration**:
   - `prev_in [7:0]`: Register to store the state of the input signal from the previous clock cycle.

3. **Always Block**:
   - **Edge Detection Logic**: The always block is triggered on every rising edge of the clock. 
     - `anyedge <= in & ~prev_in;` checks for a change from 0 to 1 by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current input and the negation of the previous input.
     - `prev_in <= in;` updates the previous input with the current input signal at each rising edge of the clock.

This module will detect a rising edge transition for each bit of the input signal and set the corresponding bit in the `anyedge` output high for one clock cycle after the transition.
