Based on the specified task and structured solving process, we'll write the Verilog code for the combinational circuit with the seven different logic gate operations applied to the inputs `a` and `b`.

Here is the Verilog code for the `top_module`:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out_and,
    output wire out_or,
    output wire out_xor,
    output wire out_nand,
    output wire out_nor,
    output wire out_xnor,
    output wire out_anotb
);
    // Logic gate operations
    assign out_and = a & b;         // AND operation
    assign out_or = a | b;          // OR operation
    assign out_xor = a ^ b;         // XOR operation
    assign out_nand = ~(a & b);     // NAND operation
    assign out_nor = ~(a | b);      // NOR operation
    assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b);     // XNOR operation
    assign out_anotb = a & ~b;      // AND operation with NOT of b

endmodule
```

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Module Declaration**:
    - Inputs: `a`, `b` (both declared as `input wire` since they are single-bit inputs).
    - Outputs: `out_and`, `out_or`, `out_xor`, `out_nand`, `out_nor`, `out_xnor`, `out_anotb` (all declared as `output wire` since they are single-bit outputs).

2. **Assign Statements**:
    - Each output is computed using a basic logic operation:
      - `out_and`: AND operation between `a` and `b`.
      - `out_or`: OR operation between `a` and `b`.
      - `out_xor`: XOR operation between `a` and `b`.
      - `out_nand`: NAND operation between `a` and `b`.
      - `out_nor`: NOR operation between `a` and `b`.
      - `out_xnor`: XNOR operation between `a` and `b`.
      - `out_anotb`: AND operation between `a` and NOT `b`. 

This design meets the requirements for a combinational circuit with diverse logic gate operations, producing the corresponding results from the input signals `a` and `b`.
