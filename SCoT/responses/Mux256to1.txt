Based on the outlined chain of thought, here is the Verilog code to implement a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [255:0] in,   // 256-bit wide input vector
    input wire [7:0] sel,    // 8-bit select signal
    output wire out          // 1-bit output
);

    // Multiplexer logic: out is the bit in `in` at position `sel`
    assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

This code defines the `top_module` with a 256-bit input vector `in`, an 8-bit select signal `sel`, and a 1-bit output `out`. The `assign` statement selects the bit at position `sel` in the input vector `in` and assigns it to `out`. This approach leverages Verilog's capability to dynamically index vectors, providing an efficient and succinct implementation of the 256-to-1 multiplexer.
