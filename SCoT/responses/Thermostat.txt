Here is the Verilog module "top_module" for the described heating/cooling thermostat system:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire too_cold,
    input wire too_hot,
    input wire mode,
    input wire fan_on,
    output wire heater,
    output wire aircon,
    output wire fan
);

    // Heater logic: Heater is on when mode is heating (mode = 1) and too_cold = 1
    assign heater = mode && too_cold;

    // Air conditioner logic: Aircon is on when mode is cooling (mode = 0) and too_hot = 1
    assign aircon = ~mode && too_hot;

    // Fan logic: Fan is on when either heater or aircon is on, or fan_on is high
    assign fan = heater || aircon || fan_on;

endmodule
```

In this module:
- The `heater` output is high (`1`) when the `mode` is heating (`1`) and the `too_cold` signal is high (`1`).
- The `aircon` output is high (`1`) when the `mode` is cooling (`0`, so `~mode` is `1`) and the `too_hot` signal is high (`1`).
- The `fan` output is high (`1`) when either the `heater` or `aircon` is on, or the `fan_on` signal is high (`1`).
