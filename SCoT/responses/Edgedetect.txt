Here's the complete code for the task described in the chain of thought:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

    // Intermediate signal to store the previous state of 'in'
    reg [7:0] in_prev;

    // Sequential logic to capture positive edge transitions
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Detect transitions from 0 to 1
        pedge = (in & ~in_prev);
        
        // Update 'in_prev' to the current state of 'in'
        in_prev <= in;
    end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
    - **clk:** The clock signal.
    - **in[7:0]:** 8-bit input vector.
    - **pedge[7:0]:** 8-bit output vector indicating positions where a positive edge (0 to 1 transition) was detected.

2. **Intermediate Signal:**
    - **in_prev:** This 8-bit register stores the state of the input vector `in` from the previous clock cycle.

3. **Sequential Logic:**
    - **always block:** Triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
        - Inside the block, `pedge` is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between `in` and the bitwise NOT of `in_prev`. This operation detects where there is a transition from 0 (in `in_prev`) to 1 (in `in`).
        - The state of `in` is then stored in `in_prev` for the next clock cycle's comparison.

This implementation detects and indicates where each bit of the input vector `in` transitions from 0 to 1 on each clock cycle and produces the corresponding output vector `pedge`.
