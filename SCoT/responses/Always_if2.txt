Here is the Verilog code for the given instructions fixed as described in the chain of thought:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire cpu_overheated,
    input wire arrived,
    input wire gas_tank_empty,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    always @* begin
        // Shut off computer only if CPU is overheated
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        else
            shut_off_computer = 0;

        // Continue driving if not arrived and gas tank is not empty
        if (arrived)
            keep_driving = 0;
        else if (gas_tank_empty)
            keep_driving = 0;
        else
            keep_driving = 1;
    end
    
endmodule
```

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
    - The inputs are `cpu_overheated`, `arrived`, and `gas_tank_empty`.
    - The outputs are `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving`.

2. **shut_off_computer Logic:**
    - The `always` block evaluates the condition of `cpu_overheated`.
    - If `cpu_overheated` is true, `shut_off_computer` is set to 1.
    - If `cpu_overheated` is false, `shut_off_computer` is set to 0.
  
3. **keep_driving Logic:**
    - The `always` block evaluates the conditions of `arrived` and `gas_tank_empty`.
    - If `arrived` is true, `keep_driving` is set to 0.
    - If `arrived` is false but `gas_tank_empty` is true, `keep_driving` is set to 0.
    - If neither `arrived` is true nor `gas_tank_empty` is true, `keep_driving` is set to 1 to continue driving.

By using conditional checks for both `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving`, we ensure no intermediate undesirable states or latches are created, and the required behavior is correctly implemented.
