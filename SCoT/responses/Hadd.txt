Here is the Verilog code for a half adder following the outlined thought process:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire sum,
    output wire cout
);
    // Half adder logic:
    // sum is the XOR of a and b
    // cout is the AND of a and b
    assign sum = a ^ b;
    assign cout = a & b;
endmodule
```

Explanation:
- **Inputs `a` and `b`:** Single-bit inputs representing the binary numbers to be added.
- **Outputs `sum` and `cout`:** Single-bit outputs representing the sum and carry-out, respectively.
- **Logic Implementation:**
    - `assign sum = a ^ b;` computes the sum using the XOR operation.
    - `assign cout = a & b;` computes the carry-out using the AND operation.
