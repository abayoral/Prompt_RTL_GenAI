Following the provided chain of thought, let's implement the top module for a 32-bit adder using two instances of the given `add16` module. 

The module will include intermediate signals and split the 32-bit inputs into their lower and upper 16-bit parts, leveraging the carry-out from the first 16-bit adder as the carry-in for the second 16-bit adder. Here's the Verilog code:

```verilog
module add16 (
    input wire [15:0] a,
    input wire [15:0] b,
    input wire cin,
    output wire [15:0] sum,
    output wire cout
);
    // Assume add16 implementation here
endmodule

module top_module (
    input wire [31:0] a,
    input wire [31:0] b,
    output wire [31:0] sum
);
    // Intermediate signals for the carry-out and partial sums
    wire [15:0] sum_lower16;
    wire [15:0] sum_upper16;
    wire cout1;

    // Instantiate the first 16-bit adder for the lower part
    add16 adder1 (
        .a(a[15:0]),
        .b(b[15:0]),
        .cin(1'b0),   // No initial carry-in
        .sum(sum_lower16),
        .cout(cout1)
    );

    // Instantiate the second 16-bit adder for the upper part
    add16 adder2 (
        .a(a[31:16]),
        .b(b[31:16]),
        .cin(cout1),  // Carry-out from the first adder
        .sum(sum_upper16),
        .cout()       // Carry-out not used for final 32-bit adder
    );

    // Concatenate the lower and upper 16-bit sums into the final 32-bit sum
    assign sum = {sum_upper16, sum_lower16};

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The `top_module` is declared with 32-bit inputs `a` and `b`, and a 32-bit output `sum`.
2. **Intermediate Signals**: 
   - `sum_lower16` and `sum_upper16` are used to store the results of the lower and upper parts of the addition.
   - `cout1` is the carry-out from the first adder, which serves as the carry-in for the second adder.
3. **First `add16` Instance**: Computes the lower 16 bits of the sum and generates a carry-out (`cout1`).
4. **Second `add16` Instance**: Uses `cout1` as its carry-in to compute the upper 16 bits of the sum.
5. **Concatenation**: Combines `sum_upper16` and `sum_lower16` to form the final 32-bit `sum`.

With this implementation, the 32-bit addition is effectively managed using two 16-bit adders, maintaining modularity and clarity.
