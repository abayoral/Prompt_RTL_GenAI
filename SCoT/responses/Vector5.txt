Let's implement a Verilog module based on the given steps and requirements.

Here's the Verilog code for the module `top_module` to compute the pairwise comparisons of five 1-bit signals (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`), producing a 25-bit output vector:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    input wire e,
    output wire [24:0] out
);

    // Pairwise comparison using XNOR to check for equality
    assign out = {
        a ~^ a, a ~^ b, a ~^ c, a ~^ d, a ~^ e, // (a with others)
        b ~^ a, b ~^ b, b ~^ c, b ~^ d, b ~^ e, // (b with others)
        c ~^ a, c ~^ b, c ~^ c, c ~^ d, c ~^ e, // (c with others)
        d ~^ a, d ~^ b, d ~^ c, d ~^ d, d ~^ e, // (d with others)
        e ~^ a, e ~^ b, e ~^ c, e ~^ d, e ~^ e  // (e with others)
    };

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
    - The module has five 1-bit inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.
    - The module produces a 25-bit output vector: `out`.

2. **Pairwise Comparisons:**
    - The `assign` statement uses XNOR (`~^`) to compare each pair of inputs. The XNOR operation results in `1` if the two bits are equal, otherwise `0`.

3. **Concatenation:**
    - The results of all 25 pairwise comparisons are concatenated in a single `assign` statement. This avoids the need for intermediate signals and makes the implementation straightforward.
    - Each bit in the `out` vector corresponds to the result of one XNOR comparison.

By following the stated steps and mapping out each comparison correctly, we ensure that the module produces the accurate 25-bit vector as required.
