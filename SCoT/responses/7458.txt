Given the design requirements for the 7458 chip, let's implement the Verilog module for it. We'll follow the steps outlined in the chain of thought to ensure a systematic approach. Hereâ€™s the detailed implementation:

**Steps:**

1. Understand the requirements, inputs, outputs, and intermediate signals.
2. Define the module and the relevant intermediate signals.
3. Implement the AND and OR gate logic.
4. Drive the module outputs based on the intermediate results and the overall logic.

**Implementation:**

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f,
    input wire p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output wire p1y, p2y
);
    // Define intermediate signals for AND gates
    wire and1_out, and2_out, and3_out, and4_out;

    // Implement AND gate logic for part 1
    assign and1_out = p1a & p1b;
    assign and2_out = p1c & p1d;
    assign and3_out = p1e & p1f;

    // Implement OR gate logic for part 1
    assign p1y = and1_out | and2_out | and3_out;

    // Implement AND gate logic for part 2
    assign and4_out = p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d;

    // Implement OR gate logic for part 2 (single AND gate output directly drives p2y)
    assign p2y = and4_out;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - The module has a total of 10 inputs (p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f for the first part (p1); p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d for the second part (p2)).
   - The module outputs are p1y and p2y.

2. **Intermediate Signals:**
   - Four intermediate signals (`and1_out`, `and2_out`, `and3_out`, `and4_out`) are declared to represent the results of the AND operations.

3. **AND Gate Logic:**
   - The AND gates for the first part of the chip are implemented and assigned to `and1_out`, `and2_out`, and `and3_out`.
   - The AND gate for the second part of the chip is implemented and assigned to `and4_out`.

4. **OR Gate Logic:**
   - The output `p1y` is derived from the OR operation on `and1_out`, `and2_out`, and `and3_out`.
   - The output `p2y` is directly derived from the `and4_out` as there is only one AND gate in the second part.

This accurately captures the logic of the 7458 chip using Verilog, ensuring the correct operation of the specified inputs and outputs.
