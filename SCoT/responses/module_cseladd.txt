Let's break down the implementation of the design given the requirements and step-by-step thought process.

### Sub-Modules

1. **16-bit Adder Module**
   - Adds two 16-bit numbers and produces a 16-bit sum and a carry-out.

2. **16-bit 2-to-1 Multiplexer**
   - Selects one of the two 16-bit inputs based on the control signal and passes it to the output.

### Top-Level Module

- Combines the sub-modules to realize a 32-bit adder.

Let's start with the 16-bit adder and multiplexer modules first.

#### 16-bit Adder Module

```verilog
module adder_16bit (
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [15:0] B,
    output wire [15:0] Sum,
    output wire Carry
);
    assign {Carry, Sum} = A + B;
endmodule
```

#### 16-bit 2-to-1 Multiplexer Module

```verilog
module mux_2to1_16bit (
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [15:0] B,
    input wire sel,
    output wire [15:0] Y
);
    assign Y = (sel) ? B : A;
endmodule
```

### Top-Level Module

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [31:0] a,
    input wire [31:0] b,
    output wire [31:0] sum
);
    // Intermediate signals
    wire [15:0] sum_lower;
    wire carry_lower;
    wire [15:0] sum_upper_1, sum_upper_2;
    wire carry_upper_1, carry_upper_2;
    wire [15:0] sum_upper;

    // Instantiate 16-bit adder for lower 16 bits
    adder_16bit adder1 (
        .A(a[15:0]),
        .B(b[15:0]),
        .Sum(sum_lower),
        .Carry(carry_lower)
    );

    // Instantiate 16-bit adder for upper 16 bits without carry
    adder_16bit adder2 (
        .A(a[31:16]),
        .B(b[31:16]),
        .Sum(sum_upper_1),
        .Carry(carry_upper_1)
    );

    // Instantiate 16-bit adder for upper 16 bits with carry
    adder_16bit adder3 (
        .A(a[31:16]),
        .B(b[31:16]),
        .Sum(sum_upper_2),
        .Carry(carry_upper_2)
    );

    // Instantiate 16-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer
    mux_2to1_16bit mux (
        .A({carry_upper_1, sum_upper_1[15:1]}), // Adjusted to handle carry propagation
        .B(sum_upper_2),
        .sel(carry_lower),
        .Y(sum_upper)
    );

    // Combine lower and upper sums to form a 32-bit sum output
    assign sum = {sum_upper, sum_lower};

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **16-bit Adder**:
   - `adder_16bit` takes two 16-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, and produces a 16-bit sum and a carry-out.

2. **16-bit 2-to-1 Multiplexer**:
   - `mux_2to1_16bit` selects between the two sets of upper sums depending on the carry generated from the lower sum.

3. **Top-Level Module**:
   - Three instances of `adder_16bit` are created: 
        - The first adder handles the least significant 16 bits.
        - The second and third adders handle the most significant 16 bits with and without the carry from the least significant bits respectively.
   - The multiplexer chooses between the sum outputs from the second and third adders based on the carry from the first adder.
   - Finally, the sum from the multiplexer is concatenated with the sum from the first adder to form the final 32-bit sum.

This modular approach ensures that the logic is clean and each sub-module can be separately tested and validated.
