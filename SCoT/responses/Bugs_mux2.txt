```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [7:0] a,
    input wire [7:0] b,
    input wire sel,
    output wire [7:0] out
);
    // Multiplexer logic: out is b if sel is high, a if sel is low
    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `top_module`, with the inputs and outputs specified correctly.
2. **Inputs**:
    - `a` and `b` are 8-bit vectors.
    - `sel` is a single-bit control signal.
3. **Output**: `out` is an 8-bit vector.
4. **Logic**:
    - The `assign` statement sets `out` to `b` if `sel` is high (`1`), otherwise it sets `out` to `a`.
    - This is achieved using the ternary conditional operator (`? :`).

This implementation ensures that the 2-to-1 multiplexer correctly selects between two 8-bit inputs based on the control signal.
