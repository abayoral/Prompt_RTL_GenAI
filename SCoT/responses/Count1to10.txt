Below is the Verilog module for the decade counter as described in your chain of thought:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,         // Clock input
    input wire reset,       // Synchronous reset input
    output reg [3:0] q      // 4-bit output to hold the current counter value
);

    // Always block triggered by the rising edge of the clock
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Reset condition: assign 1 to the counter
            q <= 4'd1;
        end else if (q == 4'd10) begin
            // If the counter reaches 10, reset to 1
            q <= 4'd1;
        end else begin
            // Otherwise, increment the counter
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration:**
    - The module is named `top_module` and has inputs for `clk` (clock) and `reset` (synchronous reset), and a 4-bit output `q`.

2. **Always Block:**
    - An always block is used to handle the clock events.
    - This block triggers on the rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`).

3. **Reset Logic:**
    - Inside the always block, the first check is for the `reset` signal.
    - If `reset` is high (`reset` is asserted), set `q` to `1` (`4'd1`). This resets the counter to 1.

4. **Counter Logic:**
    - If the counter value `q` equals 10 (`4'd10`), it will loop back and set `q` to 1.
    - Otherwise, the counter `q` is incremented by 1 with every clock pulse.

This module satisfies the requirements for a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10 and resets correctly when required.
