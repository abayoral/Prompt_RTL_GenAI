Based on the chain of thought provided, it is clear that the output `out` should always be `1` regardless of the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here is the Verilog code that reflects this logic:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    output wire out
);
    // Since the output is always 1, we directly assign 1 to out
    assign out = 1;
endmodule
```

This module declaration includes the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the output `out`. Since the Karnaugh map reveals that the output is always `1`, the value of `1` is assigned directly to `out`, making the implementation straightforward.
