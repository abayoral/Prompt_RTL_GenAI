Certainly! Your steps to understand the requirements and simplify the K-map are clear. Now, let's translate this into the Verilog module. Here is the implementation based on your final SOP equation `out = a'b'cd + a'd'b + cd + ab`.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire out
);

    // Simplified Boolean expression
    assign out = (~a & ~b & c & d) | (~a & ~d & b) | (c & d) | (a & b);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration:** The inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are declared along with the output `out`.
- **Assign Statement:** The simplified Boolean expression is used directly in the assign statement to produce the output `out`.

This code correctly implements the logic derived from your K-map simplification and should work as expected.
