Given the chain of thought, let's implement the Verilog module following the structured approach.

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire x,
    input wire y,
    output wire z
);
    // Define intermediate signal
    wire intermediate;

    // Compute intermediate result: x XOR y
    assign intermediate = x ^ y;

    // Compute final output: intermediate AND x
    assign z = intermediate & x;
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration:**
   - The module is named `top_module`.
   - It has two inputs `x` and `y`, and one output `z`.

2. **Intermediate Signal:**
   - We define an intermediate signal called `intermediate` to store the result of the XOR operation between `x` and `y`.

3. **Compute Intermediate Result:**
   - We use an `assign` statement to compute the intermediate result, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `x` and `y`.

4. **Compute Final Output:**
   - We use another `assign` statement to compute the final output `z` by performing a bitwise AND operation between the intermediate result and `x`.

This implementation follows the given requirements and structured approach, ensuring the correct combinational logic function.
