Based on the provided chain of thought, below is the Verilog code for a 100-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [99:0] a,
    input wire [99:0] b,
    input wire sel,
    output wire [99:0] out
);
    // Multiplexer logic: out is b if sel is high, a if sel is low
    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;
endmodule
```

Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `top_module`. It has three inputs (`a`, `b`, and `sel`) and one output (`out`).
2. **Inputs and Outputs**:
    - `a`: 100-bit input vector.
    - `b`: 100-bit input vector.
    - `sel`: 1-bit control signal.
    - `out`: 100-bit output vector.
3. **Assign Statement**: The `assign` statement uses a ternary operator to set the value of `out` based on the `sel` signal. If `sel` is `1`, `out` is assigned the value of `b`. If `sel` is `0`, `out` is assigned the value of `a`.
