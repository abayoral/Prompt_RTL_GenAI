Based on the chain of thought provided for creating a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer, we'll implement the module in Verilog. Here is the generated Verilog code following the detailed steps:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire sel,
    output wire out
);
    // Multiplexer logic: out is b if sel is high, a if sel is low
    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;
endmodule
```

### Explanation
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - The module is named `top_module`.
   - The inputs are `a`, `b`, and `sel`, all of which are one-bit wide (`input wire`).
   - The output is `out`, which is also one-bit wide (`output wire`).
   
2. **Multiplexer Logic:**
   - The `assign` statement implements the multiplexer logic using a ternary conditional operator.
   - If `sel` is 1, `out` gets the value of `b`.
   - If `sel` is 0, `out` gets the value of `a`.

This simple yet effective implementation meets the specified requirements for a 2-to-1 multiplexer.
