Based on the given requirements and solving process, here is the Verilog code to compare two 2-bit inputs, A and B, and produce an output z which is 1 if A equals B, and 0 otherwise.

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire [1:0] A,
    input wire [1:0] B,
    output wire z
);
    // Comparison logic: z is 1 if A equals B, otherwise z is 0
    assign z = (A == B);
endmodule
```

This module has two 2-bit inputs (`A` and `B`) and a 1-bit output (`z`). The `assign` statement is used to set `z` to 1 if `A` is equal to `B`, otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
