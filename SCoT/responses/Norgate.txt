Based on the outlined requirements and solving process, we can generate the Verilog code for a NOR gate as follows:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out
);
    // Intermediate signal for the OR operation result
    wire or_result;
    
    // OR operation
    assign or_result = a | b;
    
    // Invert the OR result to implement the NOR gate
    assign out = ~or_result;
endmodule
```

In this implementation:

1. The `or_result` intermediate signal holds the result of the OR operation between inputs `a` and `b`.
2. The `out` signal is assigned the inverted value of `or_result`, thereby implementing the NOR function.
