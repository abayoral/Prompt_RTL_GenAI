### Verilog Module for an 8-Bit Array of D Flip-Flops with Asynchronous Reset

Given the detailed understanding of the requirements, inputs, outputs, and structural design, we can now proceed to write the Verilog code for the 8-bit array of D flip-flops. Each flip-flop has an active high asynchronous reset and is triggered by the positive edge of the clock. 

Here's the Verilog code to implement the described functionality:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire areset,
    input wire [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);
    // Always block sensitive to asynchronous reset and positive edge of the clock
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            q <= 8'b0; // When areset is high, set q to zero
        end
        else begin
            q <= d; // On positive edge of clk, set q to d
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration:**
   - The module is named `top_module`.
   - Inputs are declared: `clk` (clock signal), `areset` (active high asynchronous reset), and `d` (8-bit data input).
   - The output is declared: `q` (8-bit data output).

2. **Always Block:**
   - The always block is triggered by either the rising edge of `clk` or any change in `areset`.
   - Inside the always block:
     - If `areset` is high, the output `q` is set to zero (`8'b0`).
     - Otherwise, on each rising edge of `clk`, the output `q` takes the value of the input `d`.

This code ensures that the array of D flip-flops correctly handles the asynchronous reset, setting the output to zero when the reset is high, and capturing the input data on the rising edge of the clock otherwise.
