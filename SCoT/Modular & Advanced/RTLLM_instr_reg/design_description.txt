As a seasoned Verilog designer, you are tasked with developing a module named `instr_reg` that is integral to the functioning of a CPU. This module's primary role is to capture and process CPU instructions, which may originate from multiple sources, and then meticulously parse them into separate fields for subsequent operations.

The architectural overview of the `instr_reg` module includes defining several input and output ports. Specifically, the input ports consist of:
- `clk`: A clock signal utilized for maintaining synchronization across the processes. It is essential for triggering operations at defined clock edges.
- `rst`: An active-low reset signal, crucial for initializing the module and bringing the instruction registers back to a known state (typically zero) upon system reset.
- `fetch[1:0]`: A 2-bit control signal that dictates the source of the incoming instruction. Distinguishing instructions fetched from different sources, where a value of `01` implies fetching from a register and `10` indicates fetching from RAM/ROM.
- `data[7:0]`: An 8-bit data bus that carries the instruction to be processed for fetching.

The module also defines several output ports:
- `ins[2:0]`: Extracts the high-order 3 bits from the captured instruction, commonly used to identify the opcode or operation type.
- `ad1[4:0]`: Responsible for holding the lower 5 bits of the instruction, typically associated with addresses or operand specifiers required for the instruction execution.
- `ad2[7:0]`: Outputs the entire 8-bit instruction from the secondary source, maintaining the complete data integrity.

An essential aspect of the implementation is the internal mechanism where the instruction register maintains two distinct 8-bit registers (`ins_p1` and `ins_p2`). These are used to store instructions fetched from various sources. Key functionality includes:
- On the event of the clock's rising edge, the module checks the reset condition. If the reset signal is low, the system undergoes initialization by setting both registers to zero.
- The logic dictated by `fetch` determines the data flow:
  - A fetch value of `01` results in storing the incoming instruction from the `data` input into `ins_p1`.
  - A fetch value of `10` leads to storing the instruction into `ins_p2`.
  - In scenarios where these conditions are unmet, the registers retain their last known values.
- Finally, the outputs `ins`, `ad1`, and `ad2` are crafted from the stored instructions, enabling their usage in further processing stages within the CPU architecture.

This detailed description provides a comprehensive understanding of the module's functionality and operation, setting the stage for writing complete Verilog HDL code that encapsulates all these behaviors and requirements.
