Imagine you are serving as an expert in Verilog design, focusing on the creation of a Read-Only Memory (ROM) module tailored for the storage of fixed data. The primary function of this ROM module is to offer access to pre-defined data entries determined by an incoming 8-bit address input.

The module, aptly named "ROM", interacts through specific input and output ports:

1. **Input Ports:**
   - `addr [7:0]`: This 8-bit address input is essential for selecting the precise data location within the ROM memory. The 8-bit width allows for a range of 256 unique addresses.

2. **Output Ports:**
   - `dout [15:0]`: A 16-bit output port tasked with delivering the data residing at the ROM location specified by the `addr` input. It ensures the retrieval of stored information as determined by the address input.

3. **Memory Array Specification:**
   - `reg [15:0] mem [0:255]`: This declaration sets up a ROM structure composed of 256 distinct memory locations, each capable of holding a 16-bit data value. This structure is integral to the module's storage functionality.

4. **Initialization of Memory:**
   - Within the `initial` block, the ROM is preset with specified data values at certain locations. For instance, memory positions 0, 1, 2, and 3 are initialized with hexadecimal values `16'hA0A0`, `16'hB1B1`, `16'hC2C2`, and `16'hD3D3` respectively. Other memory slots may be initialized as per unique requirements.

5. **Operational Behavior:**
   - The module employs an `always @(*)` block that ensures continuous operation by outputting the appropriate data from the ROM. The specific memory location from which data is output is determined by the current `addr` input value. Given the nature of ROM as read-only memory, the module exclusively supports read operations, with no provisions for data modification or writing.

With these components and behaviors in mind, you are tasked with constructing the comprehensive Verilog code that encapsulates the functionality of this ROM module.
