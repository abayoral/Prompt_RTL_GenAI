The task at hand involves writing a Verilog module named "top_module" to serve as a submodule for a larger hierarchical sequential circuit. This submodule should include specific components: a flip-flop and a multiplexer. The objective is to define this module so that it can be instantiated three times within a larger Verilog design, enabling the sequential circuit to leverage the flip-flop and multiplexer functionality you implement here. The primary components to focus on in your "top_module" are:

1. **Inputs:**
   - `clk`: This signal represents the clock input that will drive the flip-flop. It is crucial for synchronizing state changes in your sequential circuit.
   - `L`: This signal will act as a control input. It could be related to the multiplexer functionality, influencing which data path is selected.
   - `r_in`: This signal might represent one of the data inputs to the multiplexer or part of the flip-flop logic depending on your design approach.
   - `q_in`: Similar to `r_in`, this could be another data input relevant to the multiplexer or flip-flop.

2. **Output:**
   - `Q`: The output from the flip-flop, which should reflect the data stored or processed through the submodule. This output should be registered (hence, declared with `reg`), meaning it will hold a state.

3. **Internal Logic:**
   - A **flip-flop**: A basic building block in digital electronics, used here to store a single bit of data. Your task includes defining how this flip-flop interacts with the provided inputs and clock signal to update and output state changes.
   - A **multiplexer**: A logic gate that will select between multiple inputs based on a controlling signal (in this case, likely the `L` input). You will need to define the connections and logic that allow this selection process to route the correct input into the flip-flop.

With these components, you need to integrate them such that the module can be repeatedly instantiated and utilized effectively in the broader circuit design. Consider the interaction between the flip-flop, the multiplexer, and the input signals to ensure seamless data flow and state representation. Additionally, think about how these elements will work together to facilitate a cohesive, functional part of the larger hierarchical system.
