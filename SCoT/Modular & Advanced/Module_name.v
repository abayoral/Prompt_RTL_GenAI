Consider the following scenario: You are working with a Verilog HDL design where you are required to integrate an existing module named `mod_a` into your top-level module. The module `mod_a` is defined with six ports: two outputs and four inputs. The task is to appropriately connect these ports from `mod_a` to the corresponding ports on the `top_module`. 

The ports of `mod_a` and their respective connections to `top_module` are defined as follows:
- The first output of `mod_a`, denoted as `out1`, should be connected to the output port `out1` of the `top_module`.
- The second output of `mod_a`, denoted as `out2`, should be connected to the output port `out2` of the `top_module`.
- The first input of `mod_a`, denoted as `in1`, should be connected to the input port `a` of the `top_module`.
- The second input of `mod_a`, denoted as `in2`, should be connected to the input port `b` of the `top_module`.
- The third input of `mod_a`, denoted as `in3`, should be connected to the input port `c` of the `top_module`.
- The fourth input of `mod_a`, denoted as `in4`, should be connected to the input port `d` of the `top_module`.

Given this mapping of ports, your task within the `top_module` definition is to accurately instantiate `mod_a` and make the correct connections based on the listed pairings. This will ensure that the `mod_a` module functions correctly as part of the overall design. How would you proceed to achieve this integration and ensure that all connections adhere to the given specifications in Verilog HDL?
