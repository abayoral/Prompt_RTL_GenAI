The task involves developing a hardware description using a module that simulates Rule 110, a specific type of one-dimensional cellular automaton known for its complexity and Turing-completeness. A cellular automaton like Rule 110 consists of an array of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: on (1) or off (0). The future state of a cell in this array is determined by its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors to the left and right. The provided table outlines the specific transition rules for updating the state of the "center" cell based on the states of its "left" and "right" neighbors:

```
Left  Center  Right  Center's next state
  1      1      1         0
  1      1      0         1
  1      0      1         1
  1      0      0         0
  0      1      1         1
  0      1      0         1
  0      0      1         1
  0      0      0         0
```

The name "Rule 110" is derived from reading the "Center's next state" column as a binary number, which equals 110 in decimal notation (01101110).

For this particular implementation, you need to create a system involving a one-dimensional array of 512 cells, denoted as q[511:0]. The system should evolve or update its state with each clock cycle, meaning that at every positive edge of the clock signal, the next state of every cell should be calculated based on the current states of its neighbors according to Rule 110.

An additional feature of this implementation is the load input. When the load signal is active, the entire system should be initialized with the state given by the data input (also 512 bits wide, matching the size of q). This allows for setting or resetting the initial configuration of the cellular automaton at any point in time.

You should also consider the boundaries of this cellular automaton system. For this implementation, the boundaries are fixed to zero, meaning that the non-existent cells immediately adjacent to q[0] and q[511], denoted as q[-1] and q[512], are considered to have a value of 0.

To illustrate how this automaton evolves from a specific initial state, consider starting with an initial configuration of q[511:0] = 1 (meaning q[0] = 1 and all other cells q[1] to q[511] are 0). The sequence of configurations over the first few iterations will likely look like this:

1. 1
2. 11
3. 111
4. 1101
5. 11111
6. 110001
7. 1110011
8. 11010111

Your task is to design a Verilog module, named `top_module`, that fulfills these requirements, implementing the logic for stepping the cellular automaton forward in time and initializing it with a new state when necessary. The primary challenge is to correctly apply the rule to each cell while accommodating the constraints and special conditions such as boundaries and the load mechanism.
