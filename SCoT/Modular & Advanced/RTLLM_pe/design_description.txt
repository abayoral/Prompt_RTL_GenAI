Could you assist by acting as an experienced Verilog designer to develop a Verilog module for a 32-bit integer multiplying accumulator? In this design, we need to set up a module named "pe" that features a specific set of input and output ports. Particularly, we want this module to function as a MAC_PE (Multiply-Accumulate Processing Element), where an accumulator register holds the ongoing accumulation result through multiple clock cycles.

We require the following input ports for this module:
1. **clk**: A clock signal triggering synchronous operations within the module. This is vital for the timing and sequence of operations carried out by the module.
2. **rst**: A reset signal with a dual-state capability, where a logic level of '1' activates the reset condition and a logic level of '0' deactivates it.
3. **a**: A 32-bit input serving as one operand for the multiplication operation.
4. **b**: Another 32-bit input acting as the second operand in the multiplication.

For the output, we need:
1. **c**: A 32-bit output that represents the cumulative value that results from the multiply-accumulate process.

The main function of the "pe" module is to perform the multiplication of the inputs 'a' and 'b' and accumulate this product into a register over time. This is achieved by:
- Initially, employing an accumulator register to store the ongoing result.
- Utilizing an 'always' block that responds to the rising edge of the 'clk' (clock signal) or 'rst' (reset signal). Anytime the reset is asserted, the accumulator should reset to zero.
- When the reset is not asserted, the product of inputs 'a' and 'b' is consistently added to the current value of the accumulator.

I'm looking for a comprehensive Verilog code that accurately models these specifications, detailing the structural and behavioral elements required to achieve the desired multiply-accumulate functionality. The code should demonstrate clarity and adherence to Verilog syntax standards, effectively showcasing how the accumulation process is managed across clock cycles within the "pe" module.
