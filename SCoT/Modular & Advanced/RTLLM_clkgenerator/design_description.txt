Assume the role of an experienced Verilog designer and consider the task of crafting a Verilog module titled `clkgenerator` designed to generate a periodic clock signal. This module is expected to systematically toggle its output state at regimented intervals determined by a parameter named `PERIOD`.

The core attributes of this module are as follows:

- **Module Name**: `clkgenerator`
  This identifies the module and should be used whenever the module is instantiated within other components or modules.

- **Parameter**: `PERIOD`
  By default, this parameter is set to a value of 10. The `PERIOD` parameter is pivotal as it specifies the complete cycle time of the clock signal. The parameterization allows for adjustments that influence the frequency of the generated clock signal, corresponding to the needs of various systems or simulations.

- **Output Ports**: 
  - `clk`: This is the principal output of the module, delivering the clock signal that the module generates. The `clk` signal is designed to alternate its state between logic high and low, forming a square wave pattern. The timing of these transitions hinges on the specified `PERIOD`.

For the implementation details, an initial block is employed to set the preliminary state of the `clk` signal to 0. Subsequently, the toggling of this signal occurs at intervals corresponding to half the `PERIOD`. This results in a symmetric square wave where the clock is high for half the period and low for the remaining half, thereby maintaining stability and regularity.

With these specifications in mind, outline a comprehensive Verilog code for this `clkgenerator` module, ensuring it accurately embodies the described behavior and functionality.
