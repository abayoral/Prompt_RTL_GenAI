In this task, you are required to interact with a pre-existing module labeled as `mod_a`. This module is characterized by having two outputs followed by four inputs; these are specified in order. The primary objective is to appropriately align and connect these ports with the ports specified in the `top_module`, observing the correct sequence as given.

The `top_module` is defined with six distinct ports. These are specified as four input ports labeled `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and two output ports named `out1` and `out2`. Your goal is to ensure that each port from `mod_a` is correctly connected to its corresponding port in `top_module`, maintaining the sequence consistency: the first two outputs of `mod_a` should connect to the `out1` and `out2` outputs of `top_module`, and the subsequent four inputs of `mod_a` should connect to the `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` inputs of `top_module`, respectively.

Given the above specifications, your task is to integrate code that links the ports of `mod_a` to those in the `top_module`. The appropriate sequence of matching positions is critical to successfully establishing these connections. Your solution should address how these connections manifest in code, ensuring that the ordering of the module's ports reflects the specified arrangement.
