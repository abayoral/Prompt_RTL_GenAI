Imagine that you are tasked with creating a hardware module using Verilog, specifically an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed for a 32-bit MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) CPU. In this context, you're required to implement an ALU module with several specific input and output ports.

The inputs to this module include:
- `a` and `b`: These are the two 32-bit input operands on which various arithmetic and logical operations will be performed.
- `aluc`: This is a 6-bit control signal that dictates which operation the ALU should execute out of several possible operations predefined in a list of parameters.

The outputs from this module should include:
- `r`: This is a 32-bit output that holds the result of the operation specified by `aluc`.
- `zero`: A 1-bit output indicating whether the computed result (`r`) is zero.
- `carry`: A 1-bit output flag that indicates the occurrence of a carry when applicable (particularly relevant for operations like addition).
- `negative`: This 1-bit output signals if the result (`r`) is negative.
- `overflow`: A 1-bit output flag that shows when an arithmetic overflow has occurred.
- `flag`: A general-purpose 1-bit output used to indicate the result of the set-less-than (`SLT`) and set-less-than-unsigned (`SLTU`) instructions specifically.

The operations the module needs to support, each associated with a specific 6-bit opcode, include typical arithmetic operations such as addition (`ADD`), subtraction (`SUB`), and several logical operations like AND, OR, XOR, NOR, and various shift operations (like logical left shift `SLL`, logical right shift `SRL`, etc.), in addition to the instruction load upper immediate (`LUI`).

For each operation, relevant calculations and checks need to be made inside an `always` block that utilizes a `case` statement that selects operations based on the `aluc` signal. For example, addition operations may affect the `carry` and `overflow` bits, while SLT operations would influence the `flag` bit. Shifting operations would involve modifying binary positions of bits from the operand `a`.

It's essential to handle each operation according to its specific requirements and set the output flags (`zero`, `carry`, `negative`, `overflow`, `flag`) correctly to represent the computational state and result. If `aluc` does not match any specified operation codes, the result should be set to a default state, such as high-impedance.

With these requirements in mind, how might one construct the relevant Verilog code to implement this ALU module ensuring all specified behaviors and outputs are correctly handled?
